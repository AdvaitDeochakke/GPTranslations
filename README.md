Machine translation for novels based on GPT3.5t API calls

This is an attempt at making better quality Machine Translations, translations which are not only readable, but also decent.  
Human translation will always be better because nuance, folktales, metaphors and such are incredibly difficult to capture in such a small project.  


Requires an OpenAI API key to run. Tries to minimize token usage at a rudimentary level.  
Did a version where previous translations are kept in conversation context in hopes of aiding translation, but no noticeable improvements were observed.
