On the second day of the second month, the dragon awakens.

In the twilight, in a quiet corner of a town called Niping Lane, there was a lonely and skinny young man. According to tradition, he held a candle in one hand and a peach branch in the other, illuminating the beams, walls, and wooden bed, using the peach branch to knock and drive away snakes, scorpions, centipedes, and so on. He murmured the old saying that had been passed down through generations in this town: "On the second day of the second month, candles illuminate the beams, peaches hit the walls, and there is nowhere for snakes and worms to hide in the human world."

The young man's surname was Chen, and his given name was Ping'an. His parents had passed away early. The town was famous for its porcelain, and since the founding of this dynasty, it had taken on the important task of "being appointed to supervise the burning and offer sacrificial vessels at the mausoleum". Officials from the court were stationed here all year round to oversee the affairs of the official kiln. The young man, who had no one to rely on, had started working as a potter in the kiln at a young age. At first, he could only do odd jobs and rough work, following a master with a bad temper. After struggling for a few years, he had just begun to grasp the techniques of porcelain-making. But suddenly, things changed. The town lost its status as the official kiln, and dozens of dragon kilns surrounding the town were ordered to close overnight by the government.

Chen Ping'an put down the newly cut peach branch, extinguished the candle, and walked out of the house. He sat on the steps and looked up at the starry sky.

The young man still vividly remembered his old master, Yao, who only acknowledged him as a half-apprentice. Last year, in the late autumn morning, Yao was found sitting in a small bamboo chair, facing the direction of the kiln, with his eyes closed. However, such narrow-minded people like Old Yao were in the minority.

The craftsmen in this town, who had been involved in porcelain-making for generations, did not dare to surpass the official kiln for making tribute porcelain, nor did they dare to sell the stored porcelain to the people without permission. They had to seek alternative ways to make a living. Chen Ping'an, who was fourteen years old, was also kicked out and returned to Niping Lane, continuing to guard this dilapidated old house that was almost empty. Even if Chen Ping'an wanted to squander his fortune, he had no idea where to start.

After being a vagrant for a while, Chen Ping'an couldn't find a way to earn money. With his meager savings, he barely managed to fill his stomach. A few days ago, he heard that an outsider blacksmith named Ruan had come to Qilong Lane a few blocks away, claiming to take in seven or eight apprentices for blacksmithing without paying wages, but providing meals. Chen Ping'an hurriedly went there to try his luck. Unexpectedly, the old man just glanced at him and rejected him. At that time, Chen Ping'an wondered, was blacksmithing not based on physical strength but on appearance?

It should be noted that although Chen Ping'an looked frail, his strength should not be underestimated. It was the foundation of his body that he had developed through years of pottery-making. In addition, Chen Ping'an had followed the old man Yao, traveling through the mountains and waters within a hundred miles of the town, and tasted the flavors of various soils in the surrounding area. He was willing to do any dirty and tiring work without complaining. Unfortunately, Old Yao never liked Chen Ping'an and despised the young man for lacking insight, thinking he was like a block of wood that couldn't be carved. He was far inferior to his big apprentice Liu Xianyang. It was not surprising that the old man was biased. The master leads the door, and the practice is up to the individual. For example, the same tedious pottery-making task, Liu Xianyang's skill in just half a year was equivalent to Chen Ping'an's three years of hard work.

Although Chen Ping'an might not need this skill in his lifetime, he still closed his eyes and imagined that there were green slabs and potter's wheels in front of him, and started practicing pottery-making. Practice makes perfect.

After about fifteen minutes, the young man would take a short break, shake his wrist, and repeat this cycle until he was completely exhausted. Then, Chen Ping'an would get up, stroll in the courtyard, and slowly stretch his muscles and bones. Nobody had taught Chen Ping'an all these things; he had figured them out on his own.

In the silence of the world, Chen Ping'an heard a harsh mocking laughter. He stopped in his tracks and, sure enough, saw a peer squatting on the wall, grinning without hiding his disdainful expression.

This person was Chen Ping'an's old neighbor, rumored to be the illegitimate child of the former supervisor. The supervisor, fearing criticism from the literati and imperial censors, had returned to the capital alone after performing his duties and entrusted the child to a successor who had a close relationship with him to take care of. Now that the town had inexplicably lost the qualification to produce official kiln porcelain, the supervisor in charge of overseeing the kiln affairs for the court was too preoccupied with his own survival to care about the supervisor's illegitimate child and left some silver coins before hastily heading to the capital to manage his relationships. Unknowingly, the neighbor's young man, who had already become a castaway, was living a carefree life, wandering inside and outside the town all year round with his personal maidservant, idling his time away without ever worrying about money.

The earthen walls of every household in Niping Lane were low, and the neighbor's young man could easily see the scene in Chen Ping'an's yard without even having to tiptoe. But every time he talked to Chen Ping'an, he liked to squat on the wall.

Compared to the superficial and vulgar name "Chen Ping'an," the neighbor's young man had a much more elegant name, Song Jixin. Even the maid who depended on him had a refined name, Zhigui. The girl was standing on the other side of the courtyard wall at this moment, with a pair of apricot eyes, timid and weak.

On the other side of the courtyard gate, a voice rang out, "Do you sell this maid?"

Song Jixin paused for a moment, turned his head towards the voice, and saw a well-dressed young man with a completely unfamiliar face standing outside the courtyard, smiling with his eyes.Standing next to the young man in brocade was a tall old man with fair complexion and a kind expression, gently squinting his eyes as he observed the young boys and girls in the adjacent courtyards. The old man's gaze quickly swept past Chen Ping'an without hesitation, but lingered on Song Jixin and the maidservant, his smile gradually deepening. 

Song Jixin raised an eyebrow and said, "Sell! Why not sell?" 

The young man smiled and replied, "Then tell me the price." 

The young girl widened her eyes, her face full of confusion, like a startled young deer. 

Song Jixin rolled his eyes and held up a finger, shaking it. "Ten thousand taels of silver!" 

The young man remained calm and nodded. "Deal." 

Song Jixin, seeing that the young man was not joking, quickly changed his offer. "It's ten thousand taels of gold!" 

The young man's mouth curled up. "Just kidding." 

Song Jixin's face darkened. 

The young man ignored Song Jixin and shifted his gaze to Chen Ping'an. "Thanks to you today, I was able to buy that carp. After buying it, the more I looked at it, the more delighted I became. I wanted to thank you in person, so I had Mr. Wu bring me here overnight." 

He tossed a heavy embroidered bag to Chen Ping'an with a smile. "This is my gratitude. We're even now." 

Chen Ping'an was about to say something, but the young man had already turned and left. 

Chen Ping'an furrowed his brow. 

During the day, he accidentally saw a middle-aged man carrying a fish basket walking on the street and caught a gold carp about the length of a palm. It was jumping around energetically in the bamboo basket, and Chen Ping'an felt a sense of jubilation at a glance. So he asked if he could buy it for ten wen. The middle-aged man, thinking of rewarding his own organs, saw a profit and raised the price, asking for thirty wen before he would sell. Chen Ping'an didn't have that much spare money in his pouch, and he couldn't bear to part with the golden carp, so he followed the middle-aged man, trying to bargain the price down to fifteen or even twenty wen. When the middle-aged man showed signs of relenting, the young man in brocade and the tall old man happened to pass by. Without saying a word, they bought the carp and basket for fifty wen, leaving Chen Ping'an to watch helplessly as they walked away.

Staring fixedly at the receding figures of the elder and grandson, Song Jixin recalled something and said to Chen Ping'an, "Do you still remember the four-legged snake from the first month?" 

Chen Ping'an nodded. 

How could he forget? It was still fresh in his memory. 

According to the centuries-old customs of this small town, if a snake enters one's house, it is a good omen, and the owner should never drive it away or kill it. Song Jixin was sitting on the doorstep sunbathing on the first day of the lunar month, and then a small creature that people called a four-legged snake darted into his house right in front of his eyes. Song Jixin grabbed it and threw it into the yard, thinking that the badly battered snake would be discouraged. But to his surprise, the four-legged snake, with its resilience growing from each setback, repeatedly confronted Song Jixin, who had never believed in ghosts or spirits. Infuriated, Song Jixin threw the snake into Chen Ping'an's yard. Little did he know that the next day, he found the snake curled up under his own bed. 

Song Jixin felt the girl tugging at his sleeve. 

The young man and she had a deep connection, so he instinctively swallowed the words that were about to come out of his mouth. 

What he wanted to say was that the extremely ugly four-legged snake had developed a lump on its forehead recently, resembling a horn. 

Song Jixin changed his words and said, "Chizhi and I may be leaving here next month." 

Chen Ping'an sighed. "Take care on the journey." 

Half serious and half joking, Song Jixin said, "There are some things that I definitely can't take with me. Don't take advantage of my absence to steal things." 

Chen Ping'an shook his head. 

Song Jixin suddenly burst into laughter, pointing at Chen Ping'an with his finger playfully. "As timid as a mouse, no wonder the poor can be bullied in this life. Maybe you won't be able to escape it in the next life either." 

Chen Ping'an remained silent. 

They each returned to their rooms. Chen Ping'an closed the door and lay on the hard wooden bed. The poor youth closed his eyes and murmured softly, "Pieces of peace, safety every year, pieces of peace, safety every year..."
