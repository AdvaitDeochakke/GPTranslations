On the second day of the second lunar month, the dragon raises its head. In the twilight, in a quiet corner of a town called Niping Lane, there was a lonely and skinny young man. At this moment, he was following the customs, holding a candle in one hand and a peach branch in the other, shining the beams, walls, and wooden beds, using the peach branch to tap and drive away snakes, scorpions, and centipedes. He muttered the old saying passed down through generations in this town: "On the second day of the second lunar month, candles illuminate the beams, peaches strike the walls, snakes and worms have nowhere to hide in the mortal world."

The young man's surname was Chen and his given name was Ping'an. His parents had died early. The town was famous for its porcelain, and since the founding of the dynasty, it had taken on the important role of "overseeing the firing and offering of offerings to the mausoleum" as ordered by the court. Government officials were stationed here year-round to oversee the affairs of the imperial kiln. The young man, who had no one to rely on, had become a kiln worker at a young age. At first, he could only do odd jobs and rough work, following a disgruntled apprentice. After enduring hard work for a few years, he had just begun to understand the art of pottery making when suddenly, the town lost the protection of the official kiln. Dozens of kilns surrounding the town, resembling sleeping dragons, were ordered by the government to be closed and extinguished overnight.

Chen Ping'an put down the newly cut peach branch, blew out the candle, and walked out of the house. Sitting on the steps and looking up, he gazed at the starry sky.

The young man still vividly remembered his old master, Yao, who only acknowledged him as a half-apprentice. Last autumn, in the early morning, someone found Yao sitting on a small bamboo chair, facing the direction of the kiln, with his eyes closed.

However, people like old man Yao, who insisted on being as stubborn as a bull, were few in number after all.For generations, the craftsmen of this small town only knew how to make pottery. They didn't dare to overstep their boundaries and produce tribute official kilns, nor did they dare to privately sell the stored porcelain to the common people. They had to find another way out. At the age of 14, Chen Ping'an was also expelled from his household and returned to Mud Bottle Alley. He continued to guard this dilapidated old house, which was almost a scene of destitution. Even if Chen Ping'an wanted to squander his wealth, he didn't know where to start.

After being a wandering and lonely ghost for a while, the teenager couldn't find a way to make money. With his meager savings, he barely filled his stomach. A few days ago, he heard that in a nearby street called Riding Dragon Alley, a blacksmith named Ruan from another town had come and announced that he wanted to take on seven or eight apprentice blacksmiths. He wouldn't pay them, but he would provide meals. Chen Ping'an quickly went to try his luck, but he didn't expect the old man to just give him a scornful glance and reject him. Chen Ping'an was puzzled at the time. Could it be that being a blacksmith wasn't about physical strength, but rather about one's appearance?It should be noted that although Chen Ping'an looks weak, his strength should not be underestimated. This is because of the physical foundation he developed from years of practicing making pottery. In addition, Chen Ping'an has followed an old man surnamed Yao, exploring the mountains and waters within a hundred li radius of the town, experiencing the taste of various soils in the surrounding area. He is willing to do any dirty and tiring work without complaint. Unfortunately, the old man Yao has never liked Chen Ping'an, finding the young man lacking in comprehension and not as talented as his eldest disciple Liu Xianyang. It's no wonder that the old man is biased. The teacher can only lead the way; the practice ultimately relies on the individual. For example, even though both Chen Ping'an and Liu Xianyang find making pottery boring, in just half a year, Liu Xianyang's skills have reached the level of Chen Ping'an's three years of hard work.

Although he may not need this skill in his lifetime, Chen Ping'an still closes his eyes as usual, imagining that there are green stone slabs and pottery wheels in front of him, practicing making pottery diligently to become skillful.

After approximately fifteen minutes, the young man would take a short rest, shaking his wrists. He repeats this cycle until he is completely exhausted. Then, Chen Ping'an stands up, walking in the courtyard while slowly stretching his muscles and bones. Nobody has taught Chen Ping'an all of this; he has figured it out by himself.

The world was originally silent, but Chen Ping'an suddenly hears a harsh mocking laughter. He stops in his tracks, and sure enough, he sees a peer sitting atop the wall, grinning without concealing his disdainful expression.This person is Chen Pingan's old neighbor, rumored to be the illegitimate child of the former master inspector. The master was afraid of criticism and impeachment from the officials, so he returned alone to the capital to report, leaving the child in the care of the successor who had a close personal relationship with him. Now, the small town inexplicably lost its qualification to produce official kilns. The supervising inspector responsible for overseeing the kiln affairs for the court even has trouble taking care of himself, let alone the illegitimate child of his colleagues. Leaving some money behind, he hurriedly went to the capital to network. Unknowingly, the neighboring youth has become a discarded child, but he still lives a leisurely life, wandering around the town with his maid servant, being idle all year round, never worrying about money.
The earthen courtyard walls in Mud Bottle Lane are all low, so the neighbor boy doesn't need to tiptoe to see the scenery in this yard. But every time he talks to Chen Pingan, he likes to squat on the top of the wall.
Compared to the plain and vulgar name Chen Pingan, the neighboring youth's name is much more elegant, called Song Jixin. Even the maid servant who depends on him has a delicate name, Zhi Gui.
At this moment, the young girl is standing on the other side of the courtyard wall. She has apricot-shaped eyes and looks timid and weak.
On the other side of the courtyard gate, a voice sounded, "Will you sell this maid servant?"
Song Jixin was startled, turned to look in the direction of the voice, and saw a handsome young man in brocade clothes standing outside the courtyard, with a completely unfamiliar face.
Beside the brocade-clad young man stood a tall old man with fair complexion, gentle expression, and narrowed eyes, quietly observing the two young boys and girls in the neighboring courtyards.The old man's gaze swept over Chen Ping'an without pause, but lingered on Song Jixin and the maid, his smile gradually becoming more intense.
Song Jixin squinted and said, "Sell it! Why not sell it?"
The young man smiled and said, "Then name your price."
The young girl widened her eyes, her face full of confusion, like a startled young deer.
Song Jixin rolled his eyes and held up a finger, shaking it. "Ten thousand taels of silver!"
The young man in the brocade clothes remained calm and nodded. "Alright."
Seeing that the young man didn't seem to be joking, Song Jixin quickly changed his offer. "It's ten thousand taels of gold!"
The corner of the young man's mouth curled up. "Just teasing you."
Song Jixin's face darkened.
The young man ignored Song Jixin and shifted his gaze to Chen Ping'an. "Thanks to you, I was able to buy that carp today. After buying it, the more I look at it, the happier I am. I wanted to thank you in person, so Grandfather Wu brought me here overnight."
He threw a heavy embroidered bag at Chen Ping'an and smiled brightly. "This is a token of gratitude. We're even now."
Chen Ping'an was about to speak, but the young man in brocade clothes had already turned and left.
Chen Ping'an frowned.During the day, Chen Pingan unintentionally saw a middle-aged man walking down the street with a fish basket, catching a palm-sized golden carp. It was jumping vigorously inside the bamboo basket, and Chen Pingan felt a sense of joy just by glancing at it. He then asked if he could buy it for ten coins. The middle-aged man, initially only thinking about rewarding himself, saw an opportunity for profit and immediately raised the price, demanding thirty coins before selling. Chen Pingan, who was short on money, couldn't afford that much and was unwilling to let go of the shiny carp. He followed the middle-aged man, attempting to negotiate the price down to fifteen or even twenty coins. Just as the middle-aged man seemed willing to lower the cost, a well-dressed young man and a tall old man happened to pass by. Without a word, they bought the carp and fish basket for fifty coins, leaving Chen Pingan helpless, watching them walk away into the distance.

Staring fixedly at the receding figures of the old man and his grandson, after Song Jixin regained his fierce gaze, he jumped down from the wall and seemed to remember something. He said to Chen Pingan, "Do you remember the four-legged creature from January?"

Chen Pingan nodded.
How could he forget? It was still fresh in his memory.According to the customs inherited for hundreds of years in this small town, if a snake enters one's house, it is a good sign, and the owner should not drive it away or kill it. On the first day of the Lunar New Year, Song Jixin was sitting on the doorstep sunbathing when a small creature, commonly known as a four-legged snake, crawled into his house right in front of him. Song Jixin grabbed it and threw it into the courtyard, but to his surprise, the snake, despite being thrown around, became even more determined. This angered Song Jixin, who had never believed in ghosts or gods. In a fit of anger, he threw it into Chen Ping'an's courtyard. Little did he know, the next day, Song Jixin found the snake curled up under his own bed.

Song Jixin noticed that the young girl tugged on his sleeve. As if they had a spiritual connection, he instinctively held back the words that were already about to come out of his mouth.

What he wanted to say was that the extremely ugly four-legged snake had recently developed a bump on its forehead, as if it were growing horns.

Song Jixin changed his words and said, "Zhigui and I may be leaving here next month."

Chen Ping'an sighed, "Be careful on your journey."

Song Jixin half-jokingly said, "There are some things that I definitely won't be able to take with me. Don't you dare take advantage of my house being empty and steal things."

Chen Ping'an shook his head.

Song Jixin suddenly burst into laughter, pointing at Chen Ping'an with his finger and jokingly said, "Timid as a mouse, no wonder the poor can be bullied in this lifetime. Maybe even in the next life, you won't be able to escape."

Chen Ping'an remained silent.They each returned to their rooms, Chen Pingan closed the door and lay down on the hard wooden bed. The impoverished youth closed his eyes and murmured softly, "On and on, peace and safety. On and on, peace and safety..."
