On the second day of the second month, the dragon raises its head.

In the twilight, in a quiet corner of a small town called Niping Lane, there was a lonely and thin young man. Following the customs, he held a candle in one hand and a peach branch in the other, shining it on the beams, walls, and wooden beds, tapping and knocking with the peach branch, trying to drive away snakes, scorpions, centipedes, and other creatures. He muttered something in his mouth, an old saying passed down through generations in this town: "On the second day of the second month, the candle illuminates the beams, the peach strikes the wall, and there is no place for snakes and insects in the mortal realm."

The young man's surname was Chen and his name was Ping'an. His parents had passed away early. The town was famous for its porcelain, and since the founding of the dynasty, it had taken on the important task of "burning sacrificial vessels for the imperial tomb", with imperial officials stationed here to supervise the affairs of the official kilns. As a young man with no one to rely on, he had long been working as a kiln craftsman, starting with odd jobs and heavy work. He had followed a master with a bad temper for several years. Just when he had finally grasped some techniques of porcelain making, the world changed. The town suddenly lost the protection of the official kilns, and dozens of kilns resembling sleeping dragons in the surrounding area were ordered to be closed overnight by the government.

Chen Ping'an put down the newly folded peach branch, blew out the candle, and walked out of the house. Sitting on the steps, he looked up at the sparkling starry sky.

The young man still vividly remembered the old master, who only acknowledged him as a half apprentice. His surname was Yao, and last autumn, he was found sitting on a small bamboo chair, facing the direction of the kiln, with his eyes closed.

However, there were only a few people like old Yao who were so stubborn. The craftsmen in the town, who had only been skilled in porcelain making for generations, did not dare to exceed the production of tribute kilns, nor did they dare to sell the stored porcelain to the common people without authorization. They had to seek other ways to make a living. The 14-year-old Chen Ping'an was also expelled from the town and returned to Niping Lane, continuing to guard this dilapidated old house. It was almost a scene of destitution with empty walls. Even if Chen Ping'an wanted to be a prodigal son, he didn't know where to start.

Having been a wandering soul for a while, the young man could not find a way to make money. He relied on his meager savings to barely fill his stomach. A few days ago, he heard that an outsider named Ruan, who was a blacksmith in a street called Dragon Riding Lane several blocks away, was looking to take on seven or eight apprentices. The apprentices would not be paid, but they would be provided with food. Chen Ping'an hurriedly went to try his luck, only to be rejected by the old man with a disdainful glance. At that time, Chen Ping'an was puzzled. Wasn't blacksmithing a trade that valued strength rather than appearance?

Although Chen Ping'an looked weak, his strength should not be underestimated. It was the result of years of pottery making, shaping his physical foundation. In addition, Chen Ping'an had followed old Yao, wandering through the mountains and rivers within a hundred miles of the town, tasting the various soils around, willing to do any dirty and tiring work without complaint. Unfortunately, old Yao never liked Chen Ping'an and despised the young man for lacking talent, considering him a blockhead compared to his senior apprentice Liu Xianyang. It was no wonder the old man favored his senior apprentice. The master opens the door, but the cultivation comes from the individual. For example, when it came to the dull and boring pottery shaping, Liu Xianyang's progress in just half a year could match Chen Ping'an's three years of hard work.

Although Chen Ping'an might not need this skill in his lifetime, he still closed his eyes as usual, imagining that there were green stones and pottery wheels in front of him, and he began practicing pottery shaping, becoming more skilled through practice.

Every quarter of an hour or so, the young man would take a short break, shaking his wrists, repeating this cycle until he was completely exhausted. Then Chen Ping'an would get up, walk in the courtyard, and slowly stretch his muscles and bones. No one had ever taught Chen Ping'an these things; he had figured them out on his own.

In the silence of the world, Chen Ping'an heard a harsh mocking laughter. He stopped walking and, as expected, saw a peer squatting on the top of the wall, sneering without concealing his disdainful expression.

This person was Chen Ping'an's old neighbor, rumored to be the illegitimate child of the former supervisor. That supervisor, fearing criticism and impeachment, had returned to the capital alone to report on his work and entrusted the child to the incoming official with a close personal relationship to take care of. Now that the town had inexplicably lost the qualification to produce official kilns, the supervisor responsible for overseeing the kiln affairs for the court had enough trouble protecting himself, let alone caring for the illegitimate child of his colleague. After leaving some money, he hurriedly went to the capital to arrange connections. Unknowingly, the abandoned neighbor had been living a carefree life, wandering around the town with his personal maid, enjoying a leisurely year without ever worrying about money.

The low earth walls of every house in Niping Lane did not require the neighbor to tiptoe; he could easily see the scene in this courtyard. But every time he spoke to Chen Ping'an, he liked to squat on the top of the wall.

Compared to the plain and vulgar name Chen Ping'an, the neighbor had a much more elegant name, Song Jixin. Even the maidservant who depended on him had a refined name, Zhigui. The girl was now standing on the other side of the courtyard wall, her almond-shaped eyes timid and weak.

On the other side of the gate, a voice sounded, "Are you selling this maid?"

Song Jixin was stunned for a moment and turned her head towards the voice. It was a young man in brocade clothing with a smiling face, a completely unfamiliar face standing outside the courtyard.A tall old man with fair complexion and a gentle expression stood beside a young man in embroidered clothes. He squinted his eyes and scanned the young boys and girls in the two neighboring courtyards. The old man's gaze passed over Chen Ping'an without stopping, but lingered on Song Jixin and the maidservant, his smile gradually intensifying.

Song Jixin narrowed his eyes and said, "Sell it! Why wouldn't you sell it?"
The young man smiled and said, "Then you name the price."
The girl widened her eyes, her face full of confusion, like a young deer in a panic.
Song Jixin rolled his eyes and held up a finger, shaking it. "Ten thousand taels of silver!"
The young man remained calm and nodded. "Alright."
Song Jixin saw that the young man did not seem to be joking, so he immediately changed his tune. "It's ten thousand taels of gold!"
The corner of the young man's mouth curled up. "Just kidding."
Song Jixin's face darkened.
The young man no longer paid any attention to Song Jixin. He shifted his gaze and looked at Chen Ping'an. "Thanks to you, I was able to buy that carp today. After buying it, I became more and more delighted the more I looked at it. I thought I must thank you in person, so I asked my grandfather to bring me here overnight to find you."
He tossed a heavy embroidered bag to Chen Ping'an and said with a radiant smile, "This is my gratitude. Let's consider us even."
Chen Ping'an was about to say something, but the young man had already turned and left.
Chen Ping'an frowned.

During the day, he had inadvertently seen a middle-aged man carrying a fish basket walking on the street, catching a golden carp about the size of a palm. It was jumping vigorously in the bamboo basket, and with just a glance, Chen Ping'an felt a sense of celebration. So he asked if he could buy it for ten coins. The middle-aged man had initially just wanted to reward himself, but seeing the possibility of making a profit, he immediately raised the price and refused to sell unless he was paid thirty coins. Chen Ping'an, who had little money, was unwilling to spend so much, but he was also reluctant to part with the beautiful golden carp. He followed the middle-aged man, trying to negotiate the price down to fifteen or twenty coins. Just as the middle-aged man showed signs of relenting, the young man in embroidered clothes and the tall old man happened to pass by. Without saying a word, they bought the carp and the fish basket for fifty coins. Chen Ping'an could only watch as they walked away, helpless.

Staring at the back of the father and son that receded into the distance, Song Jixin withdrew his malicious gaze. He jumped off the wall and seemed to recall something, saying to Chen Ping'an, "Do you remember the four-legged creature from the first day of the lunar month?"
Chen Ping'an nodded.
How could he not remember? It was still vivid in his memory.
According to the centuries-old custom in this town, if a snake-like creature enters one's house, it is considered a good omen, and the owner should never drive it away or kill it. Song Jixin was sunbathing on the doorstep on the first day of the lunar month when a small creature, commonly known as a four-legged snake, suddenly crawled into his house under his nose. Song Jixin caught it and threw it into the yard, thinking that would be the end of it. He never expected that the battered and bruised four-legged snake would become even more daring. Time and time again, it pushed Song Jixin, who had never believed in ghosts and gods, to the brink of madness. In a fit of anger, he threw it into Chen Ping'an's yard. Little did he know that the next day, he would find the four-legged snake coiled up under his own bed.

Song Jixin noticed the girl tugging at his sleeve.
As if reading each other's thoughts, the young man held back the words that were already on the tip of his tongue.
What he wanted to say was that recently, the incredibly ugly four-legged snake had developed a bump on its forehead, resembling a horn.
Song Jixin instead said, "Zhengui and I might leave this place next month."
Chen Ping'an sighed, "Be careful on the road."
Song Jixin half seriously and half jokingly said, "There are some things that I definitely can't take with me. Don't take advantage of the fact that no one is home and steal things."
Chen Ping'an shook his head.
Song Jixin suddenly burst into laughter, pointing at Chen Ping'an with his finger, teasingly saying, "Timid as a mouse, no wonder the poor are taken advantage of. Not only in this life will you be impoverished, maybe it will continue in the next life too."
Chen Ping'an remained silent.
They each went back to their rooms. Chen Ping'an closed the door and lay on the hard wooden bed. The impoverished young boy closed his eyes and whispered softly, "Safe, peaceful, safe, peaceful, safe, peaceful..."Note: This translation used 6938 GPT tokens
