On the second day of the second month, the dragon rises its head. In the twilight, in a quiet place called Nipin Alley in a small town, there was a lonely and thin young boy. At this moment, according to the custom, he held a candle in one hand and a peach branch in the other, shining them on the beams, walls, wooden beds, and other places. He used the peach branch to tap and drive away snakes, scorpions, centipedes, and so on. He chanted a mantra, which was an old saying passed down from generation to generation in this small town: "On the second day of the second month, candles shine on the beams, peach branches beat the walls, snakes and insects in the mortal world have nowhere to hide."

The boy's surname was Chen and his name was Ping'an. His parents had passed away early. The town was famous for its porcelain. Since the founding of the dynasty, it had taken up the important task of "burning sacrificial vessels for offering to the mausoleum" as commanded by the imperial court. Government officials were stationed here year-round to oversee the kiln affairs. With no one to rely on, the young boy had become a kiln worker at an early age. At first, he could only do odd jobs and rough work, following a temperamental half-teacher. After several years of hard work, he had just started to understand the ways of porcelain burning. However, things were unpredictable. The town suddenly lost the protection of the government kiln, and dozens of kilns resembling lying dragons in the vicinity were ordered to shut down overnight.

Chen Ping'an put down the newly folded peach branch, extinguished the candle, and walked out of the house to sit on the steps. Looking up, the starry sky was dazzling.

The boy still vividly remembered the old master who only recognized him as half an apprentice. His name was Yao, and last autumn, he was found sitting on a small bamboo chair, facing the direction of the kiln, with his eyes closed. But people like Old Yao who obsessed about small details were few in number.

The craftsmen in the town who had been engaged in porcelain burning for generations were neither daring enough to surpass the production of tribute kilns nor willing to privately sell the stored porcelain to the people. They had to seek other ways. Fourteen-year-old Chen Ping'an was also expelled from the industry. Returning to Nipin Alley, he continued to guard the old, dilapidated house. It was almost a scene of utter poverty, even if Chen Ping'an wanted to squander his money, he wouldn't know where to start.

After being a wandering lone soul for a while, the young boy couldn't find a way to make money. With his meager savings, he barely filled his stomach. A few days ago, he heard that there was a blacksmith named Ruan from a nearby street called Qilong Alley, who claimed to be looking for seven or eight apprentices, providing no salary but meals. Chen Ping'an quickly went to try his luck, but the old man only glanced at him and rejected him. At that time, Chen Ping'an wondered if blacksmithing was not about physical strength, but about a good appearance?

Although Chen Ping'an looked weak, his strength should not be underestimated. It was the foundation of his body that was honed through years of pottery making. In addition, Chen Ping'an had followed the old man named Yao, exploring the mountains and waters within a hundred miles of the town, tasting various soils in the surrounding area. He was willing to do any dirty and tiring work without complaint. Unfortunately, Old Yao never liked Chen Ping'an, finding him lacking in comprehension, like a blockhead made of elm wood, far inferior to his eldest apprentice Liu Xianyang. It was no wonder the old man showed favoritism. The master led the way, but the cultivation depended on the individual. For example, in the same monotonous and boring pottery-making, Liu Xianyang's skills in just half a year were equivalent to Chen Ping'an's three years of hard work.

Although Chen Ping'an might not need these skills in his entire life, he still closed his eyes as usual, imagining a blue stone slab and a potter's wheel in front of him, starting to practice pottery throwing, practice makes perfect.

Every quarter of an hour, the boy would take a short rest and shake his wrist. This cycle repeated until he was completely exhausted. Then Chen Ping'an stood up, walked around the courtyard, and stretched his muscles and bones. No one had taught Chen Ping'an these things; he had figured them out on his own.

Amidst the originally quiet world, Chen Ping'an heard a sharp and sarcastic laughter, and he stopped, not surprised to see the peer sitting on the wall, grinning without concealing his disdainful expression.

This person was Chen Ping'an's old neighbor, said to be the illegitimate child of the former supervising officer. The officer, fearing criticism from the Confucian scholars and accusations from the court officials, had returned to the capital alone to report, leaving the child in the care of the succeeding official, who had a close relationship with him. Now that the town inexplicably lost the qualification to burn official kilns, the supervising officer responsible for overseeing the government kiln affairs had even greater troubles to deal with, not to mention the illegitimate child of his colleague. He left some money and hurriedly went to the capital to network. Unbeknownst to him, the neighbor boy had become an abandoned child and continued to live leisurely, wandering inside and outside the town all year round, never worrying about money.

The adobe walls of every household in Nipin Alley were low. The neighbor boy didn't even need to tiptoe to see the scene in this courtyard, but he always liked to squat on the wall whenever he talked to Chen Ping'an.

Compared to the plain and vulgar name "Chen Ping'an," the neighbor boy had a much more elegant nameâ€”Song Jixin. Even the maid who relied on him for her livelihood had a literary name, Zhigui. The girl was now standing on the other side of the courtyard wall, with timid and weak almond-shaped eyes.

On the other side of the courtyard gate, a voice sounded, "Are you selling this maid?"

Song Jixin was stunned for a moment, turned his head to follow the voice, and saw a young man in brocade standing outside the courtyard, a completely unfamiliar face.

The brocade-clad young man was accompanied by a tall old man with fair complexion and a kind look. He squinted slightly as he looked at the two young boys and girls in the adjacent courtyards.

The old man's gaze passed quickly over Chen Ping'an without pausing, but on Song Jixin and the maid, it lingered for a while, and his smile gradually grew stronger.

Song Jixin said disdainfully, "Sell! Why not?"

The young man smiled and said, "Then name a price."

The girl opened her eyes wide, her face full of confusion, like a startled deer.Song Jixin rolled his eyes, extended a finger and shook it. "Ten thousand taels of silver!"
The young man in brocade remained calm and nodded. "Alright."
Seeing that the young man didn't seem to be joking, Song Jixin quickly changed his words. "It's ten thousand taels of gold!"
A smirk appeared on the young man's face. "Just kidding."
Song Jixin's face turned dark.
The young man in brocade no longer paid attention to Song Jixin. He shifted his gaze to Chen Ping'an and said, "Thanks to you today, I was able to buy that carp. When I brought it back, the more I looked at it, the more delighted I became. I wanted to thank you in person, so I asked Grandpa Wu to bring me here in the middle of the night."
He tossed a heavy embroidered bag to Chen Ping'an and said with a bright smile, "This is my gratitude. We're even now."
Chen Ping'an was about to speak, but the young man in brocade had already turned around and left.
Chen Ping'an furrowed his brows.
During the day, he happened to see a middle-aged man carrying a fish basket walking on the street. He caught a golden carp about the size of a palm in the basket. It was jumping vigorously inside, and Chen Ping'an felt a sense of cheerfulness at just a glance. So he asked if he could buy it for ten copper coins. The middle-aged man, originally thinking of rewarding his own five viscera, saw the opportunity for profit and raised the price significantly. He stubbornly demanded thirty copper coins. Chen Ping'an, short on money, couldn't afford that much, but he couldn't bear to part with the golden carp. He followed the middle-aged man, trying to negotiate the price down to fifteen or even twenty copper coins. Just as the middle-aged man was showing signs of compromise, the young man in brocade and the tall old man happened to pass by. Without saying a word, they bought the carp and the fish basket for fifty copper coins. Chen Ping'an could only helplessly watch them walk away, feeling utterly helpless.

Staring fixedly at the receding figures of the old man and his grandson, after Song Jixin withdrew his fierce gaze, he jumped off the wall and seemed to remember something. He turned to Chen Ping'an and said, "Do you remember the four-legged one from January?"
Chen Ping'an nodded.
How could he forget? It was still fresh in his memory.
According to the customs passed down for hundreds of years in this small town, if a snake entered one's house, it was considered a good omen and the homeowner must not drive it away or kill it. Song Jixin was sitting on the doorstep basking in the sun on the first day of the lunar month when a small creature called a four-legged snake jumped into his house right under his nose. Song Jixin grabbed it and threw it into the yard. Unexpectedly, the snake, already battered and bruised, grew more courageous. Time after time, it infuriated Song Jixin, who never believed in ghosts and gods, and in a fit of anger, he threw it into Chen Ping'an's yard. Who would have thought that the next day, Song Jixin found the snake coiled up under his own bed.
Song Jixin became aware that the young girl was tugging at his sleeve.
The young man and she were in sync, and he instinctively swallowed the words that were already on his lips.
What he wanted to say was that the hideous four-legged snake had grown a bump on its forehead recently, like a horn.
Song Jixin changed his words and said, "Wen Zhigui and I might be leaving here next month."
Chen Ping'an sighed, "Be careful on your journey."
Song Jixin half-jokingly said, "There are some things that I definitely can't take with me. Don't take advantage of my family's absence and steal things."
Chen Ping'an shook his head.
Song Jixin suddenly burst into laughter, pointing at Chen Ping'an with his finger and jokingly said, "Cowardly as a mouse, no wonder the poor have no noble sons in the family. Not only may I be poor and humble in this life, but I might not be able to escape it in the next life either."
Chen Ping'an remained silent.
They each went back to their respective rooms. Chen Ping'an closed the door and lay down on the hard wooden bed. The poor youth closed his eyes and murmured softly, "Pieces and peace, year after year of peace, pieces and peace, year after year of peace..."
