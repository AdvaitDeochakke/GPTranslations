In the town of Niping Lane, a remote and quiet place, on the day of the Dragon Raising Ceremony in February, a skinny and lonely teenager follows the tradition. He holds a candle in one hand and a peach branch in the other, shining them on the ceilings, walls, and wooden beds in an attempt to drive away snakes, scorpions, and centipedes. He mutters the old saying passed down for generations in the town: "On the day of the Dragon Raising, the candle shines on the ceiling, and the peach branch hits the wall. There is no hiding place for snakes and insects in the human world."

The teenager's name is Chen Ping'an, and his parents passed away a long time ago. The town is famous for its porcelain, and since the founding of the dynasty, it has been responsible for the important task of "burning sacrificial vessels for the imperial mausoleum." Officials from the court are stationed here all year round to supervise the kilns. As an orphan, the young Chen Ping'an started working as a pottery apprentice at a young age. At first, he could only do miscellaneous and rough work, following a grumpy master, enduring hardships for several years. He had just started to grasp the techniques of pottery making, but things suddenly changed. The town lost the protection of the official kiln, and dozens of kilns in the surrounding area were ordered to close overnight.

Chen Ping'an put down the newly cut peach branch, blew out the candle, and walked out of the house. Sitting on the steps, he looked up at the sparkling starry sky. He still vividly remembers his teacher, Master Yao, who only recognized him as a half-apprentice. Last autumn, early in the morning, Master Yao was found sitting on a small bamboo chair, facing the direction of the kiln, eyes closed.

However, people like the stubborn Master Yao were few. The local craftsmen, who had been engaged in porcelain making for generations, dared not exceed their boundaries by making imperial kilns or privately selling the stored porcelain to the people. They had to find other ways to make a living. Fourteen-year-old Chen Ping'an was also kicked out of the trade. Returning to Niping Lane, he continued to guard the dilapidated old house. It was a scene of desolation, and even if Chen Ping'an wanted to live an extravagant life, he didn't know where to start.

Having been a wandering ghost for some time, the young man couldn't find a way to make money. With his meager savings, he barely filled his stomach. A few days ago, he heard that a smith named Ruan came to Qilong Lane a few streets away and claimed to be looking for seven or eight apprentices to learn ironworking. He wouldn't pay wages but would provide meals. Chen Ping'an rushed over to try his luck. Unexpectedly, the old man just glanced at him and turned him away. Chen Ping'an was puzzled at the time. Did ironworking not depend on one's strength, but on their appearance?

Although Chen Ping'an looked weak, his strength should not be underestimated. It was the result of years of physical training through pottery making. In addition, he had followed the old man Yao to explore the mountains and rivers within a hundred miles of the town, tasted the various flavors of the surrounding soil, and willingly did any dirty and tiring work without complaint. Unfortunately, Old Yao never liked Chen Ping'an. He thought the young boy lacked understanding and had no talent, nowhere near as good as his eldest disciple Liu Xianyang. It was not surprising that the old man favored Liu. Teachers only take disciples in, but cultivation depends on the individual. For example, in the tedious and boring process of making pottery, Liu Xianyang's skills in just half a year were on par with Chen Ping'an's three years of hard work.

Although he might not need this skill in his entire life, Chen Ping'an still closed his eyes and imagined a green stone slab and a pottery wheel in front of him, starting to practice making pottery. He believed that practice makes perfect.

Every fifteen minutes or so, the young man would take a short break, shake his wrist, and repeat this cycle until he was completely exhausted. Then Chen Ping'an would get up, walk in the courtyard, and stretch his muscles and bones. No one had taught him these things; he figured it out on his own.

In the silence of the world, Chen Ping'an heard a mocking laughter that stopped him in his tracks. As expected, he saw a boy of the same age squatting on the wall with a contemptuous smile on his face.

This person was Chen Ping'an's old neighbor and reportedly the illegitimate child of the former supervising official. The official was afraid of critics and impeachment, so he returned to the capital alone, leaving the child under the care of the successor official, who had a good personal relationship with him. Now that the town had inexplicably lost the qualification to produce official kilns, the supervising official responsible for overseeing the kiln affairs for the court had to rush to the capital to handle his own affairs, leaving some money behind to take care of the abandoned child. The young neighbor, who had unwittingly become a castaway, lived carefree days, wandering inside and outside the town with his personal maid, living a leisurely and carefree life all year round without ever worrying about money.

The mud walls of every household in Niping Lane were low, so the young neighbor didn't need to tiptoe to see the scene in Chen Ping'an's courtyard, but he always liked to squat on the wall when talking to him.

Compared to the simple and vulgar name Chen Ping'an, the young neighbor had a more elegant name, Song Jixin. Even the maidservant who relied on him had a delicate name, Zhigui. The young girl stood on the other side of the courtyard wall at the moment, with timid and weak almond-shaped eyes.

From behind the courtyard gate, a voice was heard, "Are you selling this maidservant?"

Song Jixin hesitated and turned to look in the direction of the voice. A smiling young man in gorgeous clothes stood outside the courtyard, a completely unfamiliar face.A young man in brocade stood with a tall old man by his side. The old man had fair skin and a kind expression as he lightly squinted his eyes to observe the young boys and girls in the two adjacent courtyards. The old man's gaze quickly passed over Chen Ping'an without hesitation, but lingered longer on Song Jixin and the maid, his smile gradually growing stronger. Song Jixin sneered, "Sell it! Why wouldn't you sell it!" The young man smiled and said, "Then you name a price." The girl widened her eyes, her face full of disbelief, like a startled fawn. Song Jixin tilted his eyes and said, "Ten thousand liang of silver!" The brocade-clad young man remained calm and nodded, saying, "Okay." Song Jixin, seeing that the young man didn't seem like he was joking, quickly changed his tune, "It's ten thousand taels of gold!" The brocade-clad young man's mouth curled up and said, "Just kidding." Song Jixin's face grew sullen. The brocade-clad young man ignored Song Jixin, shifted his gaze, and looked at Chen Ping'an. "Thanks to you, I was able to buy that carp today. When I brought it back, the more I looked at it, the happier I became. I wanted to personally thank you, so I had Grandpa Wu bring me here overnight." He threw a heavy embroidered bag to Chen Ping'an, smiling brightly, "This is my way of thanking you, and now we're even." Chen Ping'an was just about to speak, but the brocade-clad young man had already turned and left. Chen Ping'an furrowed his brow. During the day, he happened to see a middle-aged man carrying a fish basket walking on the street. He had caught a golden carp about the size of a palm, and it was jumping wildly inside the bamboo basket. Chen Ping'an only glanced at it briefly, but felt a sense of celebration. So he asked if he could buy it for ten copper coins. The middle-aged man initially only wanted to reward himself for his hard work, but seeing a profit opportunity, he immediately raised the price, making a sky-high demand of thirty copper coins before he would agree to sell it. Chen Ping'an, who had little money in his pocket, and who also couldn't bear to part with the golden carp, followed the middle-aged man with longing in his eyes. He used various methods to try and lower the price to fifteen or even twenty copper coins, and just as the middle-aged man was starting to budge, the brocade-clad young man and the tall old man happened to pass by. Without a word, they bought the carp and the fish basket for fifty copper coins and left, leaving Chen Ping'an to watch them walk away in frustration and helplessness. Staring fixedly at the retreating figures of the elder and his grandson, Song Jixin withdrew his fierce gaze and jumped down from the wall, seeming to remember something. He said to Chen Ping'an, "Do you still remember the four-legged one in the first month?" Chen Ping'an nodded. How could he forget? It was fresh in his memory. According to the centuries-old custom passed down in this small town, if a snake enters someone's home, it's a good omen, and the owner must never drive it away or kill it. In the beginning of the first month, Song Jixin was sitting on the doorstep basking in the sun when a small critter, commonly known as a four-legged snake, snuck into his house right under his nose. Song Jixin caught it and threw it into the courtyard, not expecting to find it again the next day curled up under his bed. Song Jixin noticed the girl tug at his sleeve. As if they had a telepathic connection, he instinctively swallowed the words that were already at the tip of his tongue. What he wanted to say was that the incredibly ugly four-legged snake had recently developed a lump on its forehead, resembling the horn of a unicorn. Song Jixin changed his wording and said, "Chigui and I are probably leaving here next month." Chen Ping'an sighed, "Be careful on the road." Song Jixin half-jokingly said, "There are some things that I won't be able to take with me. Don't take advantage of the fact that no one is home and steal things." Chen Ping'an shook his head. Song Jixin suddenly burst into laughter, pointing at Chen Ping'an with his finger, playfully saying, "Cowardly as a mouse, no wonder the poor gate has no noble sons. Not only will you be bullied in this life, but you might not be able to escape it in the next." Chen Ping'an remained silent. They each returned to their rooms. Chen Ping'an closed the door and lay on his hard wooden bed. The poor teenager closed his eyes and whispered, "May everything be broken and peaceful, may everything be safe and peaceful..." ------------- ps1: A nearly 200,000-word special edition amidst the snow has been updated on WeChat.
