On the second day of the second month, the Dragon Rises.

In the twilight, in a remote and quiet place called Niping Alley in a small town, there was a lonely and skinny young man. At this moment, he was following the custom, holding a candle in one hand and a peach branch in the other, shining them on the beams, walls, wooden beds, and other places. He used the peach branch to knock and beat, trying to drive away snakes, scorpions, centipedes, and other creatures. He murmured words in his mouth, which were old sayings passed down from generation to generation in the town: "On the second day of the second month, candles illuminate the beams, peaches hit the walls, and there are no hiding places for snakes and insects in the human world."

The young man's surname was Chen, and his name was Ping'an. His parents had passed away early. The town was famous for its porcelain, and since the founding of the dynasty, it had been responsible for the task of "burning sacrificial vessels for the imperial mausoleum under imperial decree". Government officials were stationed here all year round to supervise the affairs of the official kiln. The young man, who had no one to rely on, started working as a kiln worker at an early age. At first, he could only do odd jobs and rough work, following a grumpy half-master. After years of hard work, he had just figured out some techniques for making porcelain, but the world was unpredictable. The town suddenly lost the charm of having an official kiln, and dozens of kilns around the town were ordered to be closed overnight.

Chen Ping'an put down the newly twisted peach branch, blew out the candle, and walked out of the house. He sat on the steps and looked up at the starry sky.

The young man still vividly remembered his half-master, who only considered him as half an apprentice. His name was Yao, and in the early autumn of the previous year, he was found sitting on a small bamboo chair, facing the direction of the kiln head, with his eyes closed.

But people like Old Man Yao, who obsessed over every little thing, were still a minority.

The craftsmen in the town, who had been involved in porcelain making for generations, dared not go beyond the boundaries of making tribute offerings for the official kiln, nor did they dare to privately sell the stored porcelain to the people. They had no choice but to find another way out. Fourteen-year-old Chen Ping'an was also driven out and returned to Niping Alley. He continued to guard this old dilapidated house, which was almost empty. Even if he wanted to live a prodigal life, he didn't know where to start.

Having been a wandering lone soul for a while, the young man couldn't find a way to make money. He could barely fill his stomach with his meager savings. A few days ago, he heard that a blacksmith named Ruan from the nearby Qilong Alley had arrived. He claimed to take in seven or eight apprentices for blacksmithing, providing food but no pay. Chen Ping'an hurriedly went to try his luck, but unexpectedly the old man just glanced at him and turned him away. At that time, Chen Ping'an was puzzled. Could it be that blacksmithing didn't depend on strength, but on appearance?

Although Chen Ping'an looked weak, his strength couldn't be underestimated. It was the foundation of his body built up through years of making porcelain. In addition to that, Chen Ping'an had followed Old Man Yao, running around the town and theAccording to the customs passed down for hundreds of years in this town, if a snake enters one's house, it is considered a good sign, and the owner should not drive it away or kill it. On the first day of the Lunar New Year, Song Jixin was sitting on the doorstep, basking in the sun, when a creature known as a four-legged snake crawled into his house right before his eyes. Song Jixin grabbed it and threw it into the yard, not expecting the snake, beaten and battered, to become even more determined. It repeatedly came back, much to the annoyance of Song Jixin, who had never believed in ghosts and gods. In a fit of anger, he threw it into Chen Ping'an's yard. Little did he know that the next day, Song Jixin would see the four-legged snake coiled up under his own bed.

Song Jixin felt a tug on his sleeve and turned to see a young girl.

The two of them had a tacit understanding, and without thinking, the words that were about to be spoken slipped back into Song Jixin's throat.

What he wanted to say was that the incredibly ugly four-legged snake had developed a lump on its forehead recently, like a horn growing out of its head.

Song Jixin changed his sentence and said, "Me and Zhigui might leave here next month."

Chen Ping'an sighed, "Be careful on your journey."

Song Jixin half-jokingly said, "There are some things I definitely can't take with me. Don't take the opportunity, while no one is at my house, to freely steal things."

Chen Ping'an shook his head.

Song Jixin suddenly burst into laughter, pointed at Chen Ping'an with his finger, and jokingly said, "Cowardly as a mouse, no wonder the poor doors have no noble sons. Not only will you be poor and humble in this lifetime, but you might not escape it in the next lifetime either."

Chen Ping'an remained silent.

They each went back to their rooms. Chen Ping'an closed the door, lying on his hard wooden bed. The poor young man closed his eyes and whispered softly, "Sui Sui Ping, Sui Sui An, Sui Sui Ping An, Sui Sui Ping Anâ€¦"
