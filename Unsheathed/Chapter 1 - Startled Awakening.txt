On the second day of the second month, the dragon awakens.
In the twilight, in a quiet place called Mud Bottle Alley, there is a lonely and thin young man. At this moment, he is following the tradition, holding a candle in one hand and a peach branch in the other, shining on the beams, walls, wooden bed, and other places, using the peach branch to tap and drive away snakes, scorpions, centipedes, etc. He mutters words in his mouth, an old saying passed down through generations in this town: "On the second day of the second month, the candle illuminates the beams, the peach strikes the walls, nowhere for the snakes and insects to hide in this world."
The young man's surname is Chen, his given name is Ping'an, and his parents passed away early. The porcelain of this small town is highly renowned. Since the founding of the dynasty, it has taken up the important task of "burning sacrificial vessels for the mausoleum as ordered by the court." Officials of the imperial court are stationed in this place, overseeing the affairs of the official kiln. The young man, with no relatives or support, started working as a kiln worker for porcelain at a young age. At first, he could only do odd jobs and rough work, following a master with a terrible temper. After toiling for several years, he has just grasped some knowledge of firing porcelain. However, things change unexpectedly, and the town suddenly lost this protective charm of having the official kiln office. Dozens of kilns resembling lying dragons around the town were all ordered to shut down overnight by the government.
Chen Ping'an put down the newly cut peach branch, blew out the candle, and walked out of the house. He sat on the steps, looking up at the sparkling starry sky.
To this day, the young man still vividly remembers his old master, Master Yao, who would only acknowledge him as a half-apprentice. Last year's late autumn morning, someone found Master Yao sitting on a small bamboo chair, facing the direction of the kiln, with his eyes closed.
However, people like Master Yao, who stubbornly adhere to their own beliefs, are ultimately few in number.For generations, the craftsmen in this small town only knew how to make porcelain. They did not dare to surpass the production of tribute pottery for the imperial kiln, nor did they dare to secretly sell their collection of porcelain to the common people. Therefore, they had no choice but to seek alternative paths. At the age of 14, Chen Ping'an was also kicked out of the house and returned to Mud Jar Alley. He continued to guard this dilapidated old house, which was almost empty and desolate. Even if Chen Ping'an wanted to squander his wealth, he wouldn't know where to start.

After wandering as a lonely ghost for a while, the young man couldn't find a way to make money. He barely managed to fill his stomach with his meager savings. A few days ago, he heard that a blacksmith named Ruan from Dragon Rider Lane, a few streets away, was looking for seven or eight apprentices. He wouldn't pay them, but would provide meals. Chen Ping'an hurriedly went to try his luck. Unexpectedly, the old man only glanced at him sideways and shut him out. At that time, Chen Ping'an was confused. Wasn't being a blacksmith about strength rather than appearance?It is important to know that although Chen Ping'an appears weak, his strength should not be underestimated. This is the foundation of his body that he developed through years of pottery making and pottery wheel exercises during his youth. In addition, Chen Ping'an also followed an old man surnamed Yao, exploring the mountains and rivers within a hundred li radius of the town and tasting the various flavors of the surrounding soil. He was willing to do any dirty and tiring work without any complaints. Unfortunately, Old Yao never liked Chen Ping'an, finding the young man lacking in intelligence and slower to learn compared to his senior disciple Liu Xianyang. It's not surprising that the old man showed favoritism, as the master can guide the disciple, but cultivation depends on the individual. For example, although both pottery making and wheel exercises are dull and tiresome, Liu Xianyang's progress in just half a year equals the level of Chen Ping'an's three years of hard work.
Although Chen Ping'an may not need this skill in his lifetime, he still closes his eyes and imagines a green stone slab and a potter's wheel in front of him, practicing pottery making as usual. He believes that practice makes perfect.
Approximately every quarter of an hour, the young man takes a short rest, shakes his wrist, and repeats this cycle until he is completely exhausted. Then, Chen Ping'an stands up, walks in the courtyard, and stretches his muscles and bones slowly. No one has ever taught Chen Ping'an these techniques; he figures them out on his own.
Originally, there was complete silence in the world. However, Chen Ping'an heard a sharp mocking laughter, stopped in his tracks, and indeed saw a peer squatting on the wall, grinning and not hiding his disdainful expression.This person is Chen Ping'an's old neighbor. It is said that he is the illegitimate child of the former supervising official. The official was afraid of criticism and impeachment, so he returned to the capital alone, leaving the child in the care of a successor who had a close relationship with him. Now the town inexplicably loses its qualification to produce official kiln ceramics. The supervising official, who is responsible for overseeing the kiln affairs on behalf of the court, is struggling to protect himself and has no time to care for his colleague's illegitimate child. Leaving some silver behind, he hurriedly went to the capital to mend relationships. Unconsciously, the neighboring teenager has become an abandoned child, but his life is still carefree. He spends his days wandering around with his personal maid, roaming inside and outside the town, enjoying a life of leisure without worrying about money all year round.

The mud walls of every household in Niping Lane are very low. In fact, the neighboring teenager doesn't even need to tiptoe to see the scenery inside the courtyard, but every time he talks to Chen Ping'an, he likes to squat on top of the wall.

Compared to the superficial and vulgar name Chen Ping'an, the neighboring teenager has a much more elegant name, Song Jixin. Even the maid who relies on him has a formal name, Zhi Gui.

At this moment, the young girl is standing on the other side of the courtyard wall, with timid eyes and a weak appearance.

On the other side of the courtyard gate, a voice sounded, "Do you sell this maid?"

Song Jixin was stunned and turned his head to look where the voice came from. It was a young man in brocade clothes, with a completely unfamiliar face, smiling and standing outside the courtyard.

Beside the young man in brocade clothes stood a tall old man with fair complexion and a kind expression. He gently narrowed his eyes and looked at the young men and women in the two adjacent courtyards.The old man's gaze swept past Chen Ping'an without pause, but lingered on Song Jixin and the maid. His smile gradually intensified.

Song Jixin squinted and said, "Sell! Why not sell!"

The young man smiled and said, "Then name your price."

The young girl widened her eyes, her face full of confusion, like a frightened young deer.

Song Jixin rolled his eyes and extended a finger, wiggling it. "Ten thousand taels of silver!"

The young man in embroidered clothes remained calm and nodded. "Alright."

Seeing that the young man didn't seem to be joking, Song Jixin quickly changed his offer. "Ten thousand taels of gold!"

A smirk appeared on the young man's lips. "Just kidding."

Song Jixin's face darkened.

The young man no longer paid attention to Song Jixin and shifted his gaze towards Chen Ping'an. "Thanks to you, I was able to buy that carp today. After buying it, the more I looked at it, the happier I became. I thought I must thank you in person, so I asked Grandpa Wu to bring me here overnight."

He threw a heavy embroidered bag to Chen Ping'an and smiled brightly. "This is a token of gratitude. We're even now."

Chen Ping'an was about to speak, but the young man in embroidered clothes had already turned and left.

Chen Ping'an furrowed his eyebrows.During the day, by chance, Chen Ping'an saw a middle-aged man walking on the street carrying a fish basket. He caught a palm-sized golden carp that was jumping vigorously inside the bamboo basket. Chen Ping'an took a quick glance and felt that it was very auspicious. So he asked if he could buy it for ten coins. The middle-aged man was originally thinking about treating himself to a good meal, but seeing the opportunity for profit, he immediately raised the price and insisted on selling it for thirty coins. However, Chen Ping'an, with limited money in his pocket, couldn't afford that much, and he was reluctant to let go of the golden carp. He followed the middle-aged man, using various methods to persuade him and hoping to bring the price down to fifteen or even twenty coins. Just when the middle-aged man showed signs of weakening, a young man in brocade clothing and an elderly tall man happened to pass by. Without saying a word, they bought the carp and the fish basket for fifty coins. Helplessly, Chen Ping'an could only watch as they walked away with their backs getting farther and farther.
Staring fixedly at the receding figures of the old man and the young man, after Song Jixin recovered from his fierce gaze, he jumped off the wall and seemed to remember something. He said to Chen Ping'an, "Do you remember the four-legged beast in the first month?"
Chen Ping'an nodded.
How could he forget? It was still fresh in his memory.According to the customs passed down for hundreds of years in this town, if a snake enters one's house, it is considered a good omen, and the owner should not drive it away or kill it. On the first day of the lunar month, Song Jixin was sitting on the doorstep, sunbathing. Suddenly, a small creature called the "four-legged snake" appeared and sneaked into his house right before his eyes. Song Jixin grabbed it and threw it into the yard, thinking that the snake, which had already been thrown around, would be deterred. However, the snake became more determined and kept coming back, which greatly infuriated Song Jixin, who never believed in ghosts and deities. In a fit of anger, he threw it into Chen Pingan's yard. Unexpectedly, the next day, he found the snake curled up under his own bed.

Song Jixin noticed that the girl tugged at his sleeve. Understanding each other's thoughts, he instinctively stopped the words that were about to come out of his mouth.

He wanted to say that the hideously ugly four-legged snake had recently developed a protrusion on its forehead, resembling the growth of a horn.

Song Jixin changed his words and said, "Chi Gui and I might leave here next month."

Chen Pingan sighed and said, "Take care on your journey."

Song Jixin half-jokingly said, "There are some things that I definitely can't take with me. Don't take advantage of my absence and steal things recklessly."

Chen Pingan shook his head.

Song Jixin suddenly burst into laughter, pointing at Chen Pingan with his finger and jokingly said, "You are such a coward. No wonder your poor family has no distinguished offspring. Not to mention being poor and humble in this lifetime, maybe you can't escape it in the next."

Chen Pingan remained silent.They each returned to their rooms. Chen Ping'an closed the door and lay down on the hard wooden bed. The impoverished youth closed his eyes and murmured softly, "Broken, broken, peace; every year, safe. Broken, broken, peace; every year, safe..."
