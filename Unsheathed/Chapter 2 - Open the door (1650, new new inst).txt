It was just starting to get light, and the rooster hadn't crowed yet, but Chen Ping'an was already up. The thin bedding couldn't retain the heat, and Chen Ping'an had developed the habit of waking up early and staying up late when he was an apprentice in the porcelain kiln. He opened the door and stepped into the soft courtyard, took a deep breath, stretched lazily, walked out of the yard, and turned his head to see a slender figure bending over, carrying a wooden bucket of water with both hands, and using her shoulders to push open the door of her own courtyard. It was Song Jixin, a maidservant from Songjiya, who had just returned from fetching water from the Iron Lock Well in Xinghua Lane.

Chen Ping'an averted his gaze, crossed streets and alleys, and ran to the east side of the town. Niping Lane was to the west of the town, and the easternmost gate was responsible for the entry and exit of merchants and the night patrol. Usually, they also collected and delivered some letters sent from outside. The next thing Chen Ping'an had to do was to deliver those letters to the townspeople. The reward was one letter and one copper coin. This was a hard-earned source of income that Chen Ping'an had worked hard to find. He had already made an appointment with them to take over this job after the Long Tai Head event in February. 

In Song Jixin's words, it was his destiny to be poor and even if he had the fortune to enter the household, Chen Ping'an couldn't hold on to it. Song Jixin often said some obscure and difficult-to-understand words, perhaps taken from books. Chen Ping'an never quite understood them. For example, a couple of days ago, Song Jixin kept mentioning something about the harsh cold of early spring freezing young people to death. Chen Ping'an didn't understand it at all. As for experiencing colder weather after surviving the winter and entering spring, Chen Ping'an had a personal understanding. Song Jixin said it was called "Reverse Spring Cold" and was as deadly as the bayonet charge on the battlefield, so many people would die at these ghostly checkpoints.

The town was not surrounded by city walls, as there were few bandits or thieves, not to mention bandits and thieves. So, in name, it was a city gate, but in reality, it was a row of old and crooked fences. It was enough to let pedestrians and vehicles pass through, which was considered the face of the town.

When Chen Ping'an ran past Apricot Blossom Lane, he saw many women and children gathering by the Iron Lock Well, and the pulley of the well was squeaking.

After passing through another street, Chen Ping'an heard a familiar sound of reading not far away. There was a rural school there, which was jointly funded by several large households in the town. The school teacher was from outside the town. When Chen Ping'an was young, he often ran to hide outside the window and secretly eavesdrop, his ears perked up. Although that teacher was strict when teaching, he didn't scold or stop Chen Ping'an and the other children who were "free readers and learners". After Chen Ping'an went to work as an apprentice in a dragon kiln outside the town, he never went to the school again.

Moving forward, Chen Ping'an passed by a stone archway. The archway had twelve stone pillars, and the locals liked to call it the "Crab Archway" because of the twelve pillars. The real name of this archway, according to Song Jixin and Liu Yangxian, was quite different. Song Jixin confidently said that in an old book called the "Local County Chronicles", it was called the "Grand Scholar Archway" and was a plaque gifted by the emperor himself to commemorate the achievements of a high-ranking official in history. Liu Yangxian, who was as na√Øve as Chen Ping'an, said it was the Crab Archway, which had been called that for hundreds of years. Why would it be called the nonsensical Grand Scholar Archway? Liu Yangxian also asked Song Jixin, "How big is the official hat of the Grand Scholar? Is it bigger than the wellhead of the Iron Lock Well?" This question made Song Jixin's face flush with embarrassment.

At this time, Chen Ping'an ran a circle around the twelve-foot archway, with four words on each side, each with a different font, namely "Do Not Hesitate", "Words Come Naturally", "Do Not Seek Externally," and "Rage Like Fighting Bulls". According to Song Jixin, except for those four words, the other three plaques were once tampered with and altered. Chen Ping'an didn't understand any of this and never thought deeply about it. Of course, even if the young man wanted to dig deeper, it would be in vain. He didn't even know what book the "Local County Chronicles", which Song Jixin often mentioned, really was.

Not far after passing the archway, Chen Ping'an soon saw an old pagoda tree with lush branches and leaves. Under the tree, there was a tree trunk that had been brought and roughly chopped by someone. Two pieces of bluestone were placed underneath on both ends, and this segment of the big tree became a simple bench. During the summer, the townsfolk liked to sit here and enjoy the cool breeze. Wealthier families would even fetch a basket of chilled fruits from the well, and the children would eat and drink to their hearts' content, forming groups and playing under the shade of the tree. Chen Ping'an was accustomed to going up the mountains and down to the waters. He ran near the gate, and stopped at the lonely yellow clay door of the house, his heart steady and his breathing calm.

There were not many outsiders coming in and out of the town, so logically speaking, with the collapse of the official kiln, there would be even fewer new faces. When Old Yao was alive, he drank too much one time and told Chen Ping'an and Liu Yangxian, his apprentices, that the official kiln business they were involved in was unique in the world. They made porcelain for the emperor and empress. Even if other common people were rich or even held high positions, if they dared to touch it, they would be beheaded. Old Yao was in an unusually good spirit that day.

Today, Chen Ping'an looked outside the fence and found many people waiting for the city gate to open, at least seven or eight of them, men, women, and children. And they were all strangers. The local people of the town rarely used the East Gate for their comings and goings. The reason was simple, the road leading out from the town's East Gate didn't have any dragon kilns or fields.At this moment, Chen Ping'an and the outsiders faced each other across a wooden fence. The young boy, wearing homemade grass shoes, couldn't help but envy the thick clothes worn by those people. They must be warm and could endure the cold. 
The people outside the gate seemed to be divided into several groups, not all belonging together. However, they all looked toward the slim youth inside the gate. Most of them wore expressionless faces, but occasionally one or two individuals would look past the youth's figure and gaze further into the town. 
Chen Ping'an was puzzled. Did these people not know that the court had already banned all dragon kilns? Or did they know the truth and see an opportunity to exploit it? 
A young man wearing a peculiar high crown and a slender figure, with a green jade pendant hanging from his waist, seemed impatient. He walked out of the crowd alone and was about to push open the unlocked gate of the fence. However, just as his fingers were about to touch the wooden door, he suddenly stopped, slowly retracted his hand, and crossed it behind his back, smiling at the grass-shoed youth inside the gate without saying a word. 
Chen Ping'an's peripheral vision caught a glimpse of the people behind the young man. Some seemed disappointed, some curious, some frowned, and some mocked. Their emotions were subtle and varied. 
Just then, a middle-aged man with messy hair suddenly opened the door and scolded Chen Ping'an, "You little bastard, have you lost your mind? Are you here so early to collect souls? Hurry up and reincarnate to see your dead parents, huh?!" 
Chen Ping'an rolled his eyes and didn't take these sarcastic words to heart. First, living in a rural place with very few books, he didn't get bothered easily by people scolding him. It would be easier for him to just jump into a well and save himself the trouble. Second, the middle-aged gatekeeper himself was often made fun of and teased by the townspeople, especially by those bold and daring women. Not only would they scold him, but some even physically fought with him. Moreover, this man loved boasting to children who wore crotch pants. For example, he would brag about how he had once fought fiercely at the city gate, beating up five or six strong men, leaving them searching for their teeth all over the ground. The road in front of the city gate, which was two zhang wide, was covered in blood, much like a muddy road after rain. 
Unimpressed with Chen Ping'an, he replied, "We'll talk about your trivial matters later." 
No one in the town took this guy seriously. But when it came to whether the outsiders could enter the town, the men held the power of life and death. 
He walked towards the gate of the wooden fence, all the while reaching into his crotch. 
The man, with his back facing Chen Ping'an, occasionally collected small embroidered bags from people after opening the gate. He would put them in his sleeve, one by one, as he allowed them to pass through. 
Chen Ping'an had long made way for them. The eight people roughly divided into five groups and walked towards the town. Besides the young man with the high crown and the green pendant, two seven or eight-year-old children also passed by. The boy wore a festive red robe, while the girl had a delicate and tender appearance, resembling a high-quality porcelain doll. 
The boy was more than half a head shorter than Chen Ping'an. When the child passed by him, he opened his mouth, although no sound came out, but his lips clearly formed words, most likely words of provocation. 
The middle-aged woman who was leading the boy coughed gently, and the child slightly restrained himself. 
Behind the middle-aged woman and the boy, an elderly man with snowy white hair led the little girl. She turned and said a long string of words to Chen Ping'an, while also pointing and gesturing to the boy in front of her. 
Chen Ping'an couldn't understand what the girl was saying, but he could guess that she was tattling on him. 
The burly old man glanced at the grass-shoed youth, who had been glanced at intentionally or unintentionally by others, and Chen Ping'an instinctively took a step back. 
Like a mouse seeing a cat. 
Seeing this scene, the previously chirpy little girl, resembling a yellow bird, abruptly lost interest in stirring up trouble. She turned her head and didn't bother to look at Chen Ping'an again, as if one more glance would dirty her eyes. 
Chen Ping'an may not have seen much of the world, but it didn't mean he couldn't understand expressions. 
After the group of people had gone far, the gatekeeper laughed and asked, "Do you want to know what they said?" 
Chen Ping'an nodded, "Yes." 
The middle-aged man chuckled, "They were praising how good-looking you are. It was all compliments." 
Chen Ping'an twitched his mouth, thinking, do you really think I'm that foolish? 
Seeing through the young boy's thoughts, the man laughed even more joyously. "If you're not stupid, can I ask you to deliver some letters?" 
Chen Ping'an didn't dare to argue, fearing that he would anger this guy and lose the money that was about to be in his hands. 
The man turned his head and looked at the people, rubbing his stubbled chin and murmuring, "That woman from earlier could crush a person with her thighs." 
Chen Ping'an hesitated for a moment and curiously asked, "Did that lady practice martial arts?" 
The man was shocked and looked down at the young boy, saying seriously, "You're really clueless, kid." 
The boy was utterly confused. 
He asked Chen Ping'an to wait and strode towards the house. When he came back, he had a stack of envelopes in his hand, not thick nor thin, about ten of them. After handing them to Chen Ping'an, he asked, "Fools have good fortune, and good people have good karma. Do you believe that?" 
Chen Ping'an held the letters in one hand and spread his palm, blinking his eyes. "We agreed on one letter for one penny." 
The man became angry and ashamed, forcefully slapping five coins into the young boy's palm. He then waved his hand grandly and said, "The rest, you owe me five pennies!"Note: This translation used 7564 GPT tokens
