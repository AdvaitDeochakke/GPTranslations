It was just barely dawn, and the rooster hadn't crowed yet, but Chen Ping'an had already gotten up. The thin bedding couldn't retain much warmth, and Chen Ping'an had developed the habit of rising early and sleeping late when he was an apprentice in the porcelain kiln. Chen Ping'an opened the door and stepped into the soft courtyard. After taking a deep breath, he stretched lazily and walked out of the yard. He turned his head and saw a delicate figure, bending over with a wooden bucket of water held in her hands, pushing open the courtyard door with her shoulder. It was Song Jixin, the servant of the Song family, who had just returned from drawing water from the Iron Lock Well in Apricot Lane. 
Chen Ping'an averted his gaze, running through the streets and alleys, heading east towards the small town. Mud Bottle Lane was on the west side of the town, and the easternmost city gate was responsible for the entry and exit of the town's commercial travelers and nighttime patrols. They also handled the delivery of some family letters sent from outside. Chen Ping'an's next task was to deliver those letters to the townspeople. The reward was one letter and one copper coin. This was the hard-earned money that he had managed to get. Chen Ping'an had already made an arrangement with them to take over this business after the Dragon-Heads-Raise day in February. 
In Song Jixin's words, Chen Ping'an was born with a poor fate. Even if he had good luck and entered the family, he still couldn't hold onto it. Song Jixin often said some obscure and incomprehensible words, probably borrowed from books. Chen Ping'an never quite understood them. For example, a few days ago, he mentioned something about the coldness of spring frost killing young people. Chen Ping'an didn't understand it at all. As for the fact that it became colder for a period of time after winter passed and spring came, he had personally experienced it. Song Jixin said it was called the "Reverse Spring Frost", just as imposing as a cavalry ambush on the battlefield. Many people would die at these ghostly checkpoints. 
The small town was not surrounded by city walls. After all, there were few bandits and thieves, let alone petty thieves. So, the city gate was nominal, actually just a row of crooked and dilapidated fences. It was sloppy, just a passageway for pedestrians and vehicles. Even with this, it was considered the face of the small town. 
When Chen Ping'an ran past Apricot Lane, he saw many women and children gathered by the Iron Lock Well, and the well wheel kept creaking and squeaking. 
After passing through another street, Chen Ping'an soon heard a familiar sound of reading not far away. There was a village school there, jointly funded by several wealthy families in the small town. The teacher was from another town. When Chen Ping'an was young, he often sneaked outside the window, squatting and eavesdropping with his ears pricked up. Although the teacher was strict when teaching, he did not scold or stop Chen Ping'an and the other "unauthorized students" from reading and gaining knowledge. Later, when Chen Ping'an became an apprentice at a porcelain kiln outside the small town, he never went to the village school again. 
Moving forward, Chen Ping'an passed through a stone archway. Because the archway had twelve stone columns, the locals liked to call it the Crab Archway. The real name of the archway was quite different according to Song Jixin and Liu Yangxian. Song Jixin solemnly claimed that it was called the Grand Scholar Archway, a bestowed archway by the emperor, in commemoration of a high-ranking official's achievements in culture and military. Liu Yangxian, a typical bumpkin like Chen Ping'an, said it should be called the Crab Archway. We have been calling it that for hundreds of years. There's no reason to call it the ridiculous Grand Scholar Archway. Liu Yangxian also asked Song Jixin a question, "How big is the hat of a Grand Scholar? Is it bigger than the opening of the Iron Lock Well?" This made Song Jixin blush. 
At this moment, Chen Ping'an ran around the twelve-foot archway, and each side had four large characters with strange fonts, each different from the others. They respectively read "When in power, do not yield," "Seek naturalness in speech," "Do not seek from outside," and "Fill with vigor like charging bulls." According to Song Jixin, except for those four characters, the other three inscriptions had been smudged and altered. Chen Ping'an was ignorant about these things, never really thought about them deeply. Of course, even if the youth wanted to get to the bottom of it, it would be in vain. He didn't even know what kind of book that Song Jixin often talked about, the Local County Chronicles. 
Not far past the archway, Chen Ping'an soon saw an old locust tree with dense branches and leaves. Under the tree, there was a tree trunk that had been moved here by someone. It had been partially cut and two pieces of bluestone were placed at the ends, serving as a makeshift bench. In summertime, the townspeople liked to sit in the shade here. The wealthier families would even fetch a basket of chilled fruits from the well, and the children would play and have fun under the tree after they were full and quenched. Chen Ping'an was used to going up the mountains and going down to the water, and he ran to the vicinity of the fence gate and stopped at the lonely yellow mud house. His heart wasn't pounding, and he wasn't out of breath. 
There were not many outsiders coming and going from the small town. In theory, with the collapse of the official kiln, there would be even fewer new faces. When Old Yao was still alive, he got drunk once and said to Chen Ping'an and Liu Yangxian, his apprentices, that they were doing a unique business in the world, the official kiln. It was the imperial porcelain used by His Majesty the Emperor and the Empress Dowager. Even if other common people were rich or held high ranks, if they dared to touch it, they would be beheaded. Old Yao that day seemed to have an unusually lofty spirit. 
Today, as Chen Ping'an looked at the people waiting to enter the city outside the fence gate, there were at least seven or eight of them, men, women, and children. And they were all strangers. The local people in the small town rarely used the east gate for entering and exiting, whether they were going to burn porcelain or do farm work. The reason was simple. The road outside the east gate of the small town extended without any kilns or fields. At this moment, Chen Ping'an and those outsiders looked at each other across a wooden fence, two by two. 
At that moment, the teenage boy in homemade straw shoes, feeling a bit envious of the thick clothes worn by those people, surely they were warm and could withstand the cold. The people outside the gate clearly consisted of several groups, not one group. But they all looked at the slim young man inside the gate, most of them with indifferent expressions. Occasionally, one or two people had already shifted their gazes past the young man's figure and looked towards a more distant place in the small town.Chen Ping'an found it strange. Could it be that these people didn't know that the imperial court had already banned all dragon kilns? Or were they aware of the truth and thought they could take advantage of it?
There was a young man wearing a peculiar tall hat. He had a slender figure and a green jade pendant hanging from his waist. He seemed impatient and walked out of the crowd alone. He wanted to push open the unlocked fence gate. However, just as his fingers were about to touch the wooden door, he suddenly stopped and slowly retracted his hand, placing them behind his back. He smiled at the grass shoes-wearing youth inside the gate without saying a word.
Chen Ping'an noticed out of the corner of his eye that the people behind the young man seemed disappointed, mocking, or frowning. Their emotions were subtle and varied.
At this moment, a middle-aged man with messy hair suddenly opened the door and scolded Chen Ping'an, "You little bastard, did money blind your eyes? Are you here so early to disturb the dead souls and meet your ghost parents?!"
Chen Ping'an rolled his eyes and didn't care about these sarcastic words. Firstly, living in this rural place with only a few books, he would get annoyed if someone scolded him, so he might as well jump into a well and save the trouble. Secondly, this middle-aged gatekeeper himself was often mocked and joked about by the townspeople, especially the bold women who not only insulted him verbally but also physically attacked him. Moreover, he loved boasting to children wearing open-crotch pants, like saying that he once had a great battle at the city gate, where he fought several big men and made them lose teeth, and the road in front of the city gate, which was as wide as two Zhang (a unit of length), was filled with blood, just like a muddy road on a rainy day!
He said to Chen Ping'an impatiently, "We'll talk about your trivial matters later."
No one in the small town took this guy seriously.
However, when it came to whether outsiders could enter the town, the men had the power of life and death.
As he walked towards the wooden fence gate, he reached into his pants.
This man against Chen Ping'an's back opened the door and occasionally collected small embroidered pouches from people, putting them into his sleeve cuff one by one before letting them pass.
Chen Ping'an had long stepped aside. The eight people were roughly divided into five groups and walked toward the small town. In addition to the young man wearing a tall hat and a green pendant, two seven or eight-year-old children had also passed by - a boy wearing a red festive robe and a girl with a delicate appearance like fine porcelain.
The boy was more than half a head shorter than Chen Ping'an. When the boy passed by him, he opened his mouth and although no sound came out, it was obvious what he said from his mouth shape. It seemed challenging.
The middle-aged woman who held the boy gently coughed, and the child slightly restrained himself.
The young girl behind the woman turned her head towards Chen Ping'an and said a long string of words while also pointing at the boy in front.
Chen Ping'an couldn't understand what the girl was saying, but he could guess that she was complaining.
The sturdy old man with frost-white hair who held the girl turned his head to glance at the grass shoes-wearing youth who had been looked at intentionally or unintentionally. Chen Ping'an instinctively took a step back.
Like a mouse seeing a cat.
After seeing this scene, the little girl who had been chirping like a little yellow sparrow lost her interest in provoking. She turned her head away and didn't look at Chen Ping'an again, as if looking at him would dirty her eyes.
Although Young Chen Ping'an was inexperienced, it didn't mean he couldn't understand facial expressions.
When the group had gone far, the gatekeeper smiled and asked, "Do you want to know what they said?"
Chen Ping'an nodded, "Yes."
The middle-aged man laughed happily, "They praised your good looks. It was all praise."
Chen Ping'an twitched the corner of his mouth, thinking, "Do you think I'm stupid?"
The man saw through the boy's thoughts and laughed even more happily, "If you're not dumb, can I let you deliver a letter?"
Chen Ping'an didn't dare to argue, fearing that it might anger this guy and he would lose the copper coins that were about to be in his hands. 
The man turned his head, looked at the people, rubbed his stubbled chin, and said in a low voice, "That woman from earlier, her legs can crush someone."
Chen Ping'an hesitated for a moment and curiously asked, "Did that lady practice martial arts?"
The man was stupefied, lowered his head to look at the boy, and solemnly said, "You, kid, are really silly."
The boy was confused.
He told Chen Ping'an to wait and walked into the house. When he came back, he had a stack of envelopes in his hand, neither thick nor thin, about ten of them. After handing them to Chen Ping'an, he asked, "Good things happen to fools, and good people get their rewards. Do you believe it?"
Chen Ping'an took the envelopes with one hand and opened his palm, blinked his eyes, and said, "You said one letter, one wen of money."
The man became furious, slapped the five copper coins he had prepared beforehand into the boy's palm, and waved his hand dramatically, saying, "You owe me the remaining five wen!"Note: This translation used 7216 GPT tokens
