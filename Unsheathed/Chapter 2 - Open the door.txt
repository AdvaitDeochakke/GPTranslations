The sky was just starting to brighten, before the rooster crowed, Chen Ping'an had already woken up. The thin bedding couldn't retain any warmth, and Chen Ping'an had already developed a habit of waking up early and sleeping late when he was an apprentice in the porcelain-making industry. Chen Ping'an opened the door and stepped into the soft soil courtyard. After taking a deep breath, he stretched lazily and walked out of the yard. He turned his head and saw a slender figure, bending over with a wooden bucket of water, using her shoulders to push open the door to her own yard. It was Song Jixin's maidservant, who had just returned from fetching water at the iron lock well in Apricot Blossom Lane. 

Chen Ping'an diverted his gaze, crossed the streets and alleys, and jogged towards the east side of the town. Mud Bottle Lane was on the west side of the town, and the easternmost city gate was guarded by someone responsible for the entry and exit of the town's merchants and the nightly patrols. They also collected and delivered some letters sent from outside. What Chen Ping'an had to do next was to deliver those letters to the townspeople. The payment was one letter for one copper coin. This was the hard-earned way he had managed to find. Chen Ping'an had already made an agreement with them. After the Dragon Raising its Head on the second day of the second lunar month, he would start taking over this business.

In Song Jixin's words, he was destined to be poor and miserable. Even if he had blessings, Chen Ping'an couldn't hold onto them. Song Jixin often said some obscure and difficult-to-understand words, probably borrowed from books. Chen Ping'an couldn't understand them very well. For example, a few days ago, he mentioned something about the freezing cold of early spring killing young people; Chen Ping'an didn't understand at all. As for experiencing that it was even colder for a period of time after winter had passed and spring arrived, he could personally feel it. Song Jixin said it was called "reversing the cold of spring," just as powerful as a spear in the battlefield, so many people would die at these gates of hell.The small town was not surrounded by city walls. After all, there were few bandits and thieves, let alone thieves and ruffians. So, in name, there were city gates, but in reality, they were just a row of old and crooked fences. It was a makeshift passage for pedestrians and vehicles, which could be considered the face of the town.

When Chen Pingan hurriedly passed by Xinghua Lane, he saw many women and children gathered by the iron well, and the well wheel kept creaking.

After turning around another street, Chen Pingan heard a familiar sound of reading not far away. There was a village school there, which was funded by several wealthy families in the town. The school teacher was an outsider. When Chen Pingan was young, he would often hide outside the window and secretly listen with pricked ears. Although the teacher was very strict during class, he did not scold or stop the children like Chen Pingan who "snuck in to study and learn". Later, Chen Pingan went to work as an apprentice in a dragon kiln outside the town and never went to the school again.Moving forward, Chen Ping'an passed by a stone archway. Due to the twelve stone columns supporting the archway, the locals liked to call it the "Crab Archway". The true name of this archway was very different according to Song Jixin and Liu Yangxian. Song Jixin firmly believed that in an old book called "Local County Records", it was referred to as the "Grand Scholar Archway," a plaque gifted by the emperor himself to commemorate a high-ranking official's accomplishments in governance and military. On the other hand, Liu Yangxian, a typical unrefined individual, insisted it was the "Crab Archway". "We've been calling it that for centuries, there's no reason to call it some nonsense 'Grand Scholar Archway'." Liu Yangxian even asked Song Jixin, "How big is the hat of a grand scholar? Is it bigger than the opening of an iron well?" This question made Song Jixin blush.

At this moment, Chen Ping'an ran a lap around the twelve-foot archway. Each side of it had four large characters, with unique fonts that were all different from each other. These characters were "To Not Hesitate in Acting", "Seek Words Naturally", "Do Not Seek Outside", and "Brimming with Courage". Song Jixin explained that except for these four characters, the inscriptions on the other three places had been smeared and tampered with. Chen Ping'an was ignorant and had never really pondered over these matters. Of course, even if the young man wanted to dig deeper, it would be in vain. He had no idea what book Song Jixin often mentioned, the "Local County Records," actually was.After passing through the archway, not far away, one quickly sees a lush old locust tree. Under the tree, there is a tree trunk that was moved to this place by someone unknown. After being roughly cut, two green stones are placed under both ends of the trunk, turning it into a makeshift bench. Every summer, the people of the small town like to relax here. Wealthy families would even retrieve a basket of chilled fruits and melons from the well. The children, after eating and drinking their fill, would form groups and play under the shade of the tree. Chen Ping'an was used to wandering in the mountains and rivers, so he ran to the entrance gate of the fence and stopped in front of the lonely yellow mud door. His heart was calm and his breathing steady.

Not many outsiders visit the town. According to reason, with the official kiln that was once a gold mine gone, there shouldn't be any new faces. When Old Yao was alive, there was one time when he got drunk and said to Chen Ping'an and Liu Xianyang, his apprentices, that what they were doing was a unique business under the heavens. They were producing imperial porcelain for the Emperor and Empress. Even if other commoners were wealthy or held high positions, daring to touch it would result in beheading. Old Yao's spirit was particularly different that day.

Today, Chen Ping'an looked outside the fence and found that many people were waiting for the city gate to open. There were at least seven or eight of them, men, women, young, and old.

Moreover, these were all strangers. The local people of the small town rarely pass through the East Gate, whether it's to burn porcelain or to work in the fields. The reason is simple - the road beyond the East Gate doesn't lead to any dragon kilns or farmland.

At this moment, Chen Ping'an and those outsiders stood facing each other, separated by a wooden fence.At that moment, the young boy wearing homemade straw shoes couldn't help but envy those people wearing thick clothes. They must be warm and able to withstand the cold. The people outside the gate seemed to be divided into several groups, not belonging to the same faction. However, they all looked at the slender young boy inside the gate. Most of them had indifferent expressions, with the occasional one or two people whose gaze had already passed through the figure of the boy and looked towards the distant town.

Chen Ping'an felt a bit strange. Did these people not know that the imperial court had already banned all dragon kilns? Or did they know the truth and thought they could take advantage of the situation? 

There was a young man with a strange tall crown on his head. He had a slender figure and a green jade pendant hanging from his waist. He seemed impatient and walked out of the crowd alone, wanting to push open the unlocked gate. However, just as his fingers were about to touch the wooden door, he suddenly stopped abruptly, slowly withdrew his hand, crossed his hands behind his back, and smiled as he looked at the young boy in straw shoes inside the gate without saying a word, just smiling.

Out of the corner of Chen Ping'an's eye, he inadvertently noticed the people behind the young man. Some seemed disappointed, some were playful, some frowned, and some sneered. Their emotions were subtle and varied.

At that moment, a middle-aged man with messy hair suddenly opened the door and cursed at Chen Ping'an, "You little bastard, did you lose your damn mind? Coming to pester me so early in the morning for the soul-calling, are you in such a hurry to be reincarnated and meet your dead parents, huh?!"Chen Ping'an rolled his eyes in response to the sarcastic remarks. The young man did not care about these words. First of all, he lived in a remote rural area with very few books. If he got annoyed by being scolded a few times, it would be better for him to jump into a well and save himself the trouble. Secondly, this middle-aged bachelor who was guarding the gate was already a subject of ridicule and jokes from the townspeople, especially those bold and daring women who not only cursed at him but also physically assaulted him. Moreover, this person loved to brag to kids wearing crotchless pants, such as boasting about how he had once had a great fight at the city gate, beating up five or six big men, their teeth scattered all over the ground, blood everywhere. The road in front of the city gate, which was two zhang wide, was nothing different from a muddy road on a rainy day!

Chen Ping'an said irritably, "Your trashy matters can wait till later."

No one in the town took this guy seriously.

However, when it came to outsiders entering the town, the man held the power of life and death.

While walking towards the wooden fence gate, he reached into his crotch.

The man, with his back to Chen Ping'an, occasionally collected small embroidered bags from people, putting them in his sleeve, and then allowed them to pass one by one.

Chen Ping'an had long given way on the road. Eight people were roughly divided into five groups, walking towards the town. Besides the young man wearing a tall crown and a green pendant around his waist, two children aged seven or eight had also passed by, a boy wearing a festive red robe and a girl with a delicate appearance, akin to fine porcelain.The boy was almost half a head shorter than Chen Ping'an. When the child brushed past him, he opened his mouth and though no sound came out, there was an obvious lip movement which seemed to be two provocative words. The middle-aged woman holding the boy gently coughed, and the child then slightly restrained himself. The little girl behind the woman, who was being led by a robust old man with a head full of white hair, turned her head and said a long string of words to Chen Ping'an, all the while pointing and gesturing at the boy in front of her. Chen Ping'an couldn't understand what the girl was saying, but he could guess that she was complaining about something. The robust old man cast a sidelong glance at the boy wearing straw shoes, who had simply glanced at him unintentionally. Chen Ping'an instinctively took a step back, like a mouse encountering a cat. Seeing this scene, the little girl, who had previously been chirping like a little yellow bird, suddenly lost interest and turned her head away, as if looking at Chen Ping'an any longer would dirty her eyes. Although the young Chen Ping'an was inexperienced, it did not mean that he couldn't read people's expressions. After the group of people had gone far away, the gatekeeper smiled and asked, "Do you want to know what they said?" Chen Ping'an nodded and said, "Yes." The middle-aged bachelor laughed and said, "They were praising how handsome you are, all good words." Chen Ping'an twitched his mouth, thinking to himself, "Do you take me for a fool?" Seeing through the young boy's thoughts, the gatekeeper laughed even more happily and said, "If you're not a fool, would you like me to let you deliver a message?" Chen Ping'an didn't dare to argue, afraid of offending this guy and losing the money that was about to come into his hands.The man turned his head and looked at those people, rubbing his stubbly chin with his hand. He muttered in a low voice, "That woman earlier could crush someone between her legs."

Chen Ping'an hesitated for a moment and curiously asked, "Has that lady practiced martial arts?"

The man was stunned, looked down at the young boy, and said seriously, "You, kid, are truly foolish."

The young boy was completely confused.

He told Chen Ping'an to wait and walked towards the house in big strides. When he came back, he had a stack of envelopes in his hand, not too thick or thin, about ten of them. After handing them to Chen Ping'an, the man asked, "Good things come to those who wait foolishly, and kind people receive good rewards. Do you believe it?"

Chen Ping'an held the letters in one hand and spread his palm with the other, blinking his eyes. "Didn't we agree on one letter for one cent?"

The man became angry and embarrassed, slapped five copper coins that he had prepared beforehand on the young boy's palm, and waved his big hand, saying boldly, "You owe me five cents for now!"Note: This translation used 7512 GPT tokens
