In a house in Tao Ye Alley, there sat an old man with a kind and gentle face, sitting on a rattan chair on the porch. Beside him sat a lively and lovely maid, wearing a light yellow patterned trousers and a light green chiffon skirt over it. She listened to the old man's stories while gently fanning herself.

The old man suddenly spoke up, "Tao Ya, Feng, are you taking a nap again? I'm not trying to scare you, but if you were in the mansion of a big family outside of town, you would be punished for being lazy."

There was no response. The old man, who had always been tolerant and lenient towards his servants, was about to tease them some more when his expression suddenly changed. He looked up towards the distance, his expression becoming serious. It turned out that in the courtyard, not only was there no sound from the young maid's fan, but even the invisible breeze had come to a standstill. The old man quickly held his breath, focused his mind, and recited a mantra, entering a meditation state in order to protect his cultivation. He sighed softly. Even Qi Jingchun, who was always strict with rules and etiquette, broke his usual behavior and took action. With this, it seemed that a storm was about to come.

At the well, a strong young man with a sturdy physique squatted not far away, staring intently at a spinning wheel. But out of the corner of his eye, he secretly glanced at the silhouette of a plump village woman. She was bending over to lift a bucket from the well, with a remarkable curve of her buttocks and heavy breasts hanging down. Her whole body exuded a wild and vibrant energy, revealing a different charm from her ordinary appearance. When the young man realized that the environment had become strangely still, he didn't move. He just summoned up his courage and stared at the enchanting image of the woman fetching water. The young man couldn't help but gulp in a mouthful of saliva and quickly turned his body, changing his squatting position.

No wonder the master had said that women from the foot of the mountain were fierce tigers, losing their power when they left the forest. But once they entered the mountain, they would become seat-taking tigers, ruling over others and capable of devouring them. After the master had a drink, he always said that all the heroes in the world have lost to their own tigers. But the young man believed that being a fierce tiger was already formidable. For example, the woman in front of him who looked ordinary but attractive made his heart itch. If she were to slap him without any reason, he wouldn't dare to fight back. If she were to laugh, he would surely follow along.

Thinking about this, the young man became a little discouraged. He lowered his head and glanced at his crotch, muttering to himself, "Without backbone, no wonder there's no courage!"

Inside Ni Ping Alley, Song Jixin was flipping through an old and heavy local county records book. Song Jixin had discovered many patterns, such as the fact that it was generally supplemented every 60 years. So Song Jixin privately named this book "Jia Zi Records." Another pattern was that once the townspeople were taken away by distant relatives when they were young, hardly anyone returned to their hometown, as if they didn't like returning to their roots. Many family surnames spread outside, and even grew into deeply rooted towering trees. So Song Jixin nicknamed it "Outside the Wall Books."

At this moment, the youth was flipping through a page of biographies, describing the life of a person named Cao Xi. The writing was concise, which was another characteristic of this county records book. Song Jixin had read it at least seven or eight times, so he was already very familiar with it. Now, in his leisure time, he would only select some bizarre and fantastical stories as if they were novels told by a storyteller. He didn't care about their authenticity. What he remembered was the man in official attire who came alone to his hometown before leaving for the capital, and told him with great solemnity to remember every name and the countless numbers of people mentioned in the book, as well as the relationships between their ancestors and the four surnames and ten clans of the town.

At this moment, Song Jixin remained motionless, like the shattered clay sculptures in the southeastern part of the town, lying casually in the grass and mud, unmoving despite the wind and rain. The light passing through the window fell on the desk, creating an unusual stillness.

The only person and thing that could move in this house were the maid Zhigui and the inconspicuous four-legged snake. She had sensed something strange early on and her first thought was to go to the neighbor's courtyard and scold the expressionless girl. However, when the maid realized the presence of a sword, she dismissed the tempting idea. She first came to her young master's room and glanced at the contents of the book page. When she saw the two characters "Cao Xi," she felt annoyed and flipped a few pages for her young master. Only when she saw the section about "Xie Shi" did she smile happily. However, she soon regretted it and turned the pages back to avoid revealing any secrets and exposing herself. Over the years, her cunning young master had only been curious and suspicious about her identity, but had never found any solid evidence. She didn't want to ruin everything just as she was about to succeed. She often accompanied her young master to the village school and felt that scholars often spoke hypocritically, such as "one who sacrifices their life for righteousness" and sometimes they said something quite reasonable, like "a journey of a hundred miles begins with a single step," which was a profound truth.The earthy yellow four-legged snake was sunbathing on the doorstep. When it remained still, it reverted to its true form. Illuminated by the sunlight, it shimmered and glistened, its body transparent like glass.

In the neighboring yard, the black-clad girl Ning Yao entered a mysterious state of prenatal breath, not breathing through her mouth or nose. She appeared as though she was still in the womb, her spirit at peace.

Inside the snow-white sword sheath, the flying sword was given amnesty. Slowly unsheathing, it fluttered gracefully around its owner, displaying an intimate and gentle demeanor like a little bird with a girl's flowing dress. It didn't fly randomly, but rather moved like a spiritual brush, creating the best feng shui spot for its owner who was currently healing. As expected, the girl, who showed no signs of breathing, absorbed the surrounding qi swiftly, as if she were a whale gulping water, drawing in the vital qi of the world. At this moment, the silence of the town contrasted sharply with the vibrant atmosphere of the house.

By the southern creek outside the town, a man with a short stature, thick eyebrows, and a sharp aura stood shirtless, hammering at the iron. With every strike, sparks flew and the room glowed brightly.

(End of this chapter, please turn the page)

Countless sparks flickered and danced throughout the spacious room, creating a magnificent spectacle.

With every strike of the hammer, a painting was formed.

On the opposite side of the man stood a girl with a neat ponytail. She was petite and wore a yellow cowhide robe to protect herself from the sparks that could easily burn through ordinary cotton clothes, leaving holes.

After each strike, the sparks that once flew throughout the room suddenly stopped in mid-air.

The ponytailed girl furrowed her brow and asked, "Father?"

The man replied in a deep voice, "It's your turn to hammer the sword rod. Take this opportunity to temper your will."

The girl put down the old sword rod and waved away the sparks that were in front of her. With a simple flick, the sparks scattered, causing the light in the room to become chaotic. Compared to the senior experts in the town who appeared as if they were hidden dragons in the depths, calmly and peacefully cultivating their minds, the girl's actions were a bit too domineering. Especially when she took over the hammering, her movements were powerful and swift, even wilder and more unrestrained than the experienced man.

Each time the sparks splattered, they didn't disappear but accumulated. After repeated strikes, the dense sparks became like countless shining stars clustered in the air.

In the room where the sword was being forged, sparks filled the space.

The man stared at the glowing red sword embryo and solemnly instructed, "Recite the Shaking Dragon chapter of the Sword Casting Manual in your mind!"

The girl's momentum suddenly dropped as she softly said, "Father?"

The man became annoyed and asked, "What now?"

The girl's momentum dropped even further as she timidly said, "I didn't eat much for lunch. I'm hungry and can't continue hammering."

The man grew even angrier and nearly cursed at her if it weren't for the sword forging. "I told you to memorize the book as if it were a matter of life or death. What excuse are you making...damn it, it's normal to be hungry with your appetite...!"

The girl giggled secretly. While her mouth complained about hunger, her movements didn't weaken in the slightest. In an instant, a flash of understanding passed between them. After a loud shout from the girl, she exerted all her strength to strike down with the hammer and unexpectedly said, "Come out!"

The sparks splattered this time were extremely dense and dazzling.

The man remained calm, thinking to himself, "It's done."

In the courtyard of the Gu family, the woman slowly woke up, with a splitting headache. With the help of her child, she sat back on the bench. Liu Zhimao, the True Lord of the Jiedao River, was meditating with his eyes closed, slowly tapping his thumb and index finger in his sleeve.

The Gu woman sat her son beside her and asked softly, "Immortal, what's going on?"

The old man didn't open his eyes and said, "I have taken on a good disciple. You have a good son, Gu. Just wait patiently for the Mother's Return."

The woman was overjoyed and tears filled her eyes as she embraced her child. She murmured, "Father of my child, can you hear us? Our Gu Can will surely achieve great things..."

Liu Zhimao suddenly uttered a sound of surprise, opened his eyes, and looked down at the lines on his palm. It seemed like a new path had appeared, and he muttered to himself, "Why is this happening? It shouldn't be so. The young man didn't die, instead, the son of that immortal family died inexplicably?"

The old man had to stand up and pace around the courtyard, quickly pinching his fingers. "Useless! Falling into the hands of a little town youth. The millennium reputation accumulated by Yunxia Mountain is ruined in an instant."

The woman felt uneasy and said, "Old immortal, now that our son has become your disciple, why not spare Chen Ping'an?"

The old man angrily shouted, "What kindness, woman! If you really had any compassion, you wouldn't have harbored murderous intentions when we first met. Coming to me now as if you're a Bodhisattva, do you have any shame?"

The woman's face turned pale, and she stammered in response, unable to say a word.

The old man was still not relieved and pointed at the woman, cursing, "Ignorant countrywoman! You have limited knowledge! After Gu Can returns with me to Shujian Lake, the number of times you and your son will meet must not be too frequent, so as not to hinder his cultivation. Do you have any objections?"

The woman hurriedly shook her head and said, "I dare not."

The old man's eyes were filled with gloom.The woman paused for a moment, then quickly came to her senses, tears streaming down her face as she pitifully said, "I have no objections, absolutely none!"

The old man waved his sleeve forcefully, coldly snorting, "This angers me!"

Just a moment ago, the woman still possessed some charm, and he had the thought of taking her as a personal slave. But now she behaved so vulgarly and without restraint, she deserved to miss out on the opportunity of entering the path of cultivation.

The old man suddenly felt as if he were facing a great enemy, surveying his surroundings. Sure enough, this entire realm had been artificially frozen into a "Boundary Realm." The Boundary Realm was a type of small world that existed in many places, and not even Immortals or Arhats could create one themselves.

This immense divine ability could be said to have reached the peak. Although it was largely thanks to the great formation, it still inspired awe and reverence in people.

Just imagine, as long as you were in this realm, regardless of whether you were a Celestial, Buddha, or demon, you would have to kowtow to me. What kind of feeling would that be?

Jiejing True Lord Liu Zhimao dreamed of reaching such heights. Is it not said that one does not utilize their ability? Go to hell with that! Liu Zhimao wished that after obtaining this small realm, he could bring in the third-generation disciples of the Buddha, Daoism, and Confucianism, not to mention making them bow and scrape, at the very least they could sit on equal footing as peers.

Without warning, Liu Zhimao coughed up a mouthful of blood. Blood also splattered from his palm, as if someone had forcefully cut a blood groove.

And on his other hand, the white bowl also appeared seemingly of its own accord. The surface of the water rippled and the black lines roamed chaotically, colliding with each other and the walls.

Without hesitation, the old man stacked his palms together, performing a Confucian bow despite being a practitioner of a different Daoist branch. He bowed deeply, devoutly and tremblingly saying, "Lord of Qingxia Island on Shujian Lake, Liu Zhimao, humbly requests Mister Qi to show mercy to the latecomer's earnest quest for the Dao. If there have been any offenses, I hope Mister Qi will not hold them against this humble person!"

After a long while, "Leave quickly!"

(This chapter is not finished. Please turn the page.)

The four words resounded in this True Lord's ears like thunder in the spring.
Liu Zhimao ecstatically said, "Rest assured, Mister Qi. I will take Lady Gu and her son to leave the town."

The old man, who had always considered himself a junior, suddenly remembered something and asked cautiously, "May I ask Mister Qi, how should these two bags of gold and copper coins on me be dealt with?"

A voice with authority sounded once again, "One person, one item. It just so happens to be two opportunities. Leave them in the courtyard. You are not allowed to leave Shujian Lake for thirty years."

Liu Zhimao felt relieved. This time, he didn't have to be so obsequious. Instead of performing a Confucian bow, he merely made a solemn Daoist bow and said, "Elder, I dare not decline your gift. Your great kindness and virtue will be forever engraved in my heart."

After this, Qi Jingchun's voice did not appear again, and the Boundary Realm soon disappeared. Without wasting any words, Liu Zhimao immediately had Lady Gu lead Gu Can and follow him out of the town. Just as Lady Gu was about to speak, she was met with a fierce and intimidating look from Liu Zhimao, causing her to tremble in fear. Liu Zhimao took out two bags without any hesitation. Although he felt reluctant, as a Daoist who held the title of a True Lord, he placed them on the bench. However, just as they were about to leave the courtyard, Liu Zhimao suddenly asked, "Did your family leave any old items behind?"

Lady Gu was puzzled, and the mischievous Gu Can immediately reminded her, "Didn't father leave behind the Multitude Treasures Pavilion? The one hidden under the bed collecting dust?"

Liu Zhimao's eyes lit up, without saying anything he immediately had Lady Gu lead the way to investigate.

Since that Sage had acknowledged that Gu Can himself was a chance encounter, it meant that this child could take away his own blessed opportunity.

As for the final ownership of these chances, in this small town, even if the heavens themselves came, they would have to defer to Qi Jingchun's decision. But once they arrived at Shujian Lake, it was hard to say.

Finally free from supervision, Gu Can grabbed both bags and rushed towards the other end of Clay Jar Alley.

Inside the house, Lady Gu kneeled on the ground, reaching into the bed to retrieve the box. It wasn't big, but it was heavy and proved to be a struggle for her. As she moved, she started panting heavily.

As a result, her plump buttocks were viciously kicked by Jiejing True Lord. The old man bantered, "Lady Gu, you really lack in postnatal care. But just based on this, it might be a bit of a stretch for you to become a second-grade servant girl on Qingxia Island. However, as a third-grade servant girl, you would be more than enough. I see that you don't please my eyes, but on Qingxia Island, there are a few guest elders. Your chances may improve, so you must strive for them and not miss out on such a good opportunity."

Lady Gu's body stiffened slightly. Her upper body was still under the bed and her expression couldn't be seen clearly.

When they reached a lane, Qi Jingchun said to Chen Ping'an, "Cai Jinjian and Fu Nanhua will be dealt with by me. Now that you have this ancestral shade of the Huai tree, you must not overlook your own life and death. Live well, that is the greatest repayment to your parents. As for the forces of Yunxia Mountain, Old Dragon City, and Jiejing True Lord in the future, I can't guarantee that they will never cause trouble for you. However, they definitely won't come looking for trouble in the next ten years. If you're lucky, you can continue to live as an ordinary citizen for thirty years without any issues."Qi Jingchun smiled and said, "There's no need to worry about the small town anymore. Soon, there won't be any more scheming here. If you want a peaceful life for the next 20-30 years, you might as well find a girl here and start a family. It's also a good thing to go outside the town and see the true world. Reading thousands of books and traveling thousands of miles are things we scholars must do. You will find that it's difficult to read in a small town, but it's easy to walk. Outside, many scholars find it easy to buy books but don't like to travel far, as they find it too difficult. The so-called traveling for study is just like a tour by car."

The young boy was surprised and asked, "Mr. Qi, is walking considered difficult too?"

Qi Jingchun laughed heartily and said, "Not to mention outside of the small town, let's just talk about what we see around us. How many people of your age have you seen running around like you, in the streets of Fulv Street or Taoye Alley?"

The young boy nodded and said, "Not many."

Qi Jingchun thought for a moment, then reached out and took out a jade hairpin from his hair bun. He bent down and handed it to the poor young boy, saying, "Consider it a parting gift. It's not a valuable item, and it's not a magical artifact. Take it without worries. Just like you, I was once a poor boy in the alley. I studied hard and went through many hardships and setbacks. Of course, there were also various encounters. When I entered the Cliff Mountain Academy and studied under my teacher, it was the happiest time of my life. Later, when my teacher left, he entrusted me with this hairpin, as a hope and trust. But unfortunately, looking back now after so many years, I haven't done well. I believe that if my teacher were still alive, he would be disappointed."

The young boy didn't dare to accept this gift.

This jade hairpin seemed to contain the teacher-student relationship between Mr. Qi and his own teacher. The affection was apparent, and the gift was not light.

Although the young boy had never seen such things before, he came from a prestigious family and still had some ability to appreciate the quality of an item.

Qi Jingchun spoke gently, "If you leave it with me, my teacher's relic will be buried along with me. It's better to give it to you. Besides, you actually deserve it. I have been staying in this small town for almost sixty years, and I have always had a lingering worry that I couldn't resolve. Unfortunately, my teacher has passed away, and I thought I would never find the answer in this lifetime. But you unknowingly helped me solve this puzzle. So I am giving you this hairpin, which is appropriate in terms of affection, reason, and etiquette. Chen Ping'an, I can only help you obtain a piece of locust leaf and cannot give you any more opportunities."

The young boy received the ordinary jade hairpin with both hands and sincerely said, "Mr. Qi, you have already done so much."

Qi Jingchun smiled and let it go. Seeing the young boy convince himself to accept the hairpin, he felt relieved. The hairpin was indeed ordinary, but it was the relic of his teacher, and it could be given to a young boy who would not tarnish the engraved name on the hairpin. It was good.

So Qi Jingchun gave his final advice, saying, "Chen Ping'an, remember, no matter what happens in the future, don't lose hope in this world."
