The small town was neither big nor small, with over six hundred households. Chen Ping'an was familiar with the poor families in the town, but the wealthy families with substantial backgrounds had high thresholds that a commoner like him couldn't cross. Chen Ping'an had never even set foot in the spacious lanes where the rich families gathered. The streets there were paved with large pieces of bluestone, and even on rainy days, one would not step into mud and splatter it all around. After being trampled and crushed by people and carriages for thousands of years, the bluestone slabs had become smooth as mirrors.

The surnames Lu, Li, Zhao, and Song were prominent in the small town, and they were the ones who funded the township school. Most of them owned two to three large dragon kilns outside the city. The official residences of the kiln supervisors were on the same street as these families.

Unfortunately, almost all of the ten letters Chen Ping'an had to deliver today were going to the wealthy and extravagant households that the town was known for. This was quite reasonable, as dragons gave birth to dragons, phoenixes gave birth to phoenixes, and mice gave birth to mice in holes. Those who could afford to send letters back home from afar must come from well-to-do families; otherwise, they wouldn't have the confidence to travel far. Among the nine letters, Chen Ping'an actually only went to two places: Fulu Street and Taoye Lane. When he first stepped on the bluestone slabs as big as bed boards, the young boy felt somewhat apprehensive. He slowed down his pace and even felt a bit ashamed, thinking that his straw shoes had dirtied the road. 

The first letter that Chen Ping'an delivered was to the Lu family, who had inherited an imperial jade ruyi from their ancestors. When the young boy stood at their door, he became even more uneasy. Wealthy families were known for their extravagance, and not to mention the Lu family's large mansion, they even had two stone lions placed at the entrance, both tall and imposing. Song Jixin said that these things could ward off evil spirits, but Chen Ping'an had no idea what evil spirits were. He was just curious about the round stone balls held in the mouths of the tall lions. How were they carved? Chen Ping'an resisted the urge to touch the stone balls, walked up the steps, and knocked on the bronze lion door knocker. Soon, a young man opened the door and walked out. When he heard that Chen Ping'an was there to deliver a letter, the man showed no expression, pinched the corner of the envelope with his fingers, took the letter, and quickly walked back into the mansion, closing the door heavily with a large gate adorned with a painted god of wealth.

The rest of the letter delivery process for the young boy was equally uneventful. At the corner of Taoye Lane, there was a family with an insignificant reputation, and the one who opened the door was a kind-looking old man. After taking the letter, he smiled and said, "Young man, you've worked hard. Would you like to come in and rest, and have a cup of hot water?" The young boy smiled shyly, shook his head, and ran away.

The old man gently put the letter into his sleeve and didn't hurry back to the courtyard. He looked into the distance with a blurry gaze. Finally, from high to low, from far to near, his gaze focused on the peach trees on both sides of the street. The seemingly senile and foolish old man squeezed out a smile. He turned around and left.

Not long after, a cute little yellow sparrow landed on a branch of a peach tree, pecking at it gently and chirping softly.

The last letter, Chen Ping'an needed to deliver it to the teacher who taught at the township school. Along the way, he passed by a fortune-telling stall where a young Taoist priest in an old Taoist robe sat up straight behind a table. He wore a tall hat that resembled a blooming lotus.

When the young Taoist priest saw the young boy running by, he quickly greeted, "Young man, don't miss this opportunity. Come draw a divination stick. I can help you predict good luck, bad luck, fortune, and disaster." Chen Ping'an didn't stop, but turned his head and waved his hand.

The priest was persistent. Leaning forward, he raised his voice, "Young man, when I used to do divination for people, I charged ten wen. Today, I'll make an exception and only charge you three wen! Of course, if you draw an upper-level divination stick, you can consider giving me an extra wen as a lucky reward. If you're extremely lucky and draw the top divination stick, I'll only charge you five wen. How about it?"

Chen Ping'an's footsteps in the distance clearly paused for a moment. The young Taoist priest quickly stood up and took advantage of the situation, loudly saying, "Early in the morning, you're my first customer, so I will be generous and charge you as little as possible. Just sit down and draw a stick, and to be honest, I will write some yellow paper talismans for you. They can help you seek blessings for your ancestors and accumulate yin virtue. With my ability, I can't guarantee that it'll bring great fortune, but if it results in an additional 1-2 blessings, it's worth a try."

Chen Ping'an hesitated and suddenly said, "I won't draw a stick. Can you just write me a yellow paper talisman?"

In Chen Ping'an's memory, it seemed like this wandering young Taoist had been in the town for at least five or six years. His appearance hadn't changed much, and he was always amiable to everyone. Usually, he helped people with bone readings, face reading, fortunetelling, and drawing divination sticks. Occasionally, he would also write family letters. Interestingly, on the table was a jar of 108 bamboo divination sticks, but in all these years, no one in the town had drawn the highest or lowest divination stick. It was as if all 108 divination sticks were good signs, with no bad ones among them.So, if it's during the holidays, and people in the small town spend ten wen to get a good luck charm, it's acceptable. But if they encounter trouble, nobody would want to be a scapegoat. If you say that this Taoist priest is a complete fraud, that would be unfair to him. This town is small, if all he does is deceive and cheat people, he would have been driven out long ago. So, the young Daoist must have some skill, it's not just about fortune telling or divination. However, for minor illnesses and ailments, many people who drank the Daoist's talisman water were quickly cured, which was quite effective.

The young Daoist shook his head and said, "I promise to do both divination and write a talisman for you, and I'll only charge you five wen."

Chen Ping'an quietly objected, "It's three wen."

The Daoist laughed, "What if it draws the best divination? Then it's five wen."

Chen Ping'an made up his mind and reached out to take the divination tube. Suddenly, he looked up and asked, "Master, how do you know that I happen to have five wen?"

The Daoist sat upright and said, "I can tell someone's fortune and wealth accurately. I'm always accurate."

Chen Ping'an thought for a moment and picked up the divination tube.

The Daoist smiled and said, "Young man, don't be nervous. When it's time in your fate, it will happen. Don't force it when it's not. Treat unexpected events with a calm mind, and you'll be fully prepared."

Chen Ping'an put the divination tube back on the table, solemnly asked, "Master, I'll give you the five wen, but instead of drawing the divination, can you write the yellow paper talisman better than usual?"

The Daoist smiled as usual, thought for a moment, and nodded, "Alright."

On the table, the writing brush, inkstone, ink, and paper were already prepared. The Daoist asked for Chen Ping'an's parents' names, birthplaces, and dates of birth, then took out a yellow talisman paper and quickly wrote on it in one breath.

As for what he wrote, Chen Ping'an had no idea.

Putting down the brush and picking up the talisman paper, the young Daoist blew on the ink marks and said, "When you bring it back home, stand at the threshold and burn the yellow paper outside, that's it."

The young man solemnly received the talisman paper, carefully put it away, and did not forget to leave five copper coins on the table as a token of appreciation. He bowed and thanked him.

The young Daoist waved his hand, signaling the young man to go about his business.

Chen Ping'an rushed off to deliver the final letter.

The Daoist lazily leaned back in his chair and glanced at the copper coins. He bent down and picked them up, just at that moment, a small exquisite yellow sparrow flew down from the sky and lightly pecked at one of the copper coins, quickly lost interest, and flew away.

"When the yellow sparrow starts to bring flowers, that's when your peach trees will blossom."

The Daoist recited this poem leisurely, then pretended to casually flick his sleeve and sighed, "Only eight feet in one's destiny. Don't ask for more."

With that flick of his sleeve, two bamboo divination sticks slipped out from his sleeve and fell to the ground. The Daoist hurriedly picked them up, then looked around sneakily and found that no one was paying attention, he breathed a sigh of relief and discreetly put the two divination sticks back into his loose cuff. The young Daoist coughed and put on a serious face, patiently waiting for the next customer.

He couldn't help but feel a bit emotional, it's easier to earn money from women.

Actually, the two bamboo divination sticks hidden in the young Daoist's cuff are used to make big money.

But that's not something for outsiders to know.

The young boy naturally had no idea about these mysteries and secrets. He continued on his way, arriving outside a village school, surrounded by lush bamboo and dripping with greenery.

Chen Ping'an slowed down his pace as a middle-aged Confucian scholar's deep voice could be heard from inside the house, "When the sun rises, a lamb's fur shines."

Then came a clear and crisp voice of a child, "When the sun rises, a lamb's fur shines."

Chen Ping'an looked up and saw the rising sun, magnificent and glorious. The young boy was mesmerized.

When he snapped out of it, he found that the school children were shaking their heads and reciting a passage as instructed by their teacher, "At the time of 'Jingzhe', the world comes alive, and all things prosper. To sleep early and rise early, taking broad steps in the courtyard, gentlemen walk slowly to cultivate their ambitions..."

Chen Ping'an stood at the entrance of the school, wanting to say something but hesitating.

The middle-aged scholar with a sprinkling of gray hair turned his head and looked over, walking out of the house gently. Chen Ping'an handed the letter to him with both hands and respectfully said, "This is the letter for sir."

The tall man in the blue gown took the envelope and spoke warmly, "When you have free time, you can come here to listen."

Chen Ping'an felt embarrassed, as he may not have the time to come and listen to this teacher's lectures. He didn't want to deceive him.

The man smiled understandingly and said, "It's okay. The principles are all in the books, but being a good person is beyond the books. You can go about your business now."

Chen Ping'an breathed a sigh of relief and bid farewell before leaving.

After running far away, he turned his head back inexplicably.

He saw that the teacher was still standing at the doorway, with his figure bathed in sunlight, looking like a divine being from a distance.Note: This translation used 6609 GPT tokens
