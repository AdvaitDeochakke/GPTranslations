The town was neither big nor small, with over 600 households. Chen Ping'an knew most of the poor families in town, but the wealthy households were out of reach for him. The spacious lanes where the wealthy families clustered together, Chen Ping'an had never even set foot in. The streets there were paved with large green stones, and even on rainy days, there would be no muddy splatters when stepping on them. These high-quality green stones had been smoothed like mirrors after being trampled upon by people and vehicles for thousands of years.

The surnames Lu, Li, Zhao, and Song were considered prominent in the town. The funds for the village school came from these families, and most of them owned 2-3 large kilns outside the city. The official residences of the kiln supervisors were located on the same street as these families.

Unfortunately, almost all of the ten letters that Chen Ping'an had to deliver today were sent to the well-to-do households in town, which was reasonable. "Like begets like," and only those with a good family background had the confidence to travel far from home. Among the nine letters, Chen Ping'an actually only went to two places, Fulu Street and Taoye Lane. When he first stepped on the large green stones as wide as beds, the young boy felt a bit nervous. He slowed down his steps and even felt a bit ashamed, thinking that his straw shoes might dirty the street.

The first letter that Chen Ping'an delivered was to the Lu family, who had received an emperor's gift of a jade ruyi. Standing in front of their door, the young boy felt even more uneasy.

Wealthy families were extravagant, and not to mention the Lu family's large mansion, they even had two stone lions placed in front of the door. The lions were tall and imposing. Song Jixin said that these things could ward off evil spirits, but Chen Ping'an had no idea what evil spirits were. He was just curious about the round stone balls that seemed to be held in the mouths of the tall lions. How were they carved? Chen Ping'an suppressed the urge to touch the stone ball and walked up the steps. He knocked on the bronze lion door knocker, and soon a young man came out. When he heard that Chen Ping'an was here to deliver a letter, the man had no expression on his face. He held the corner of the envelope between his two fingers, took the family letter, and quickly walked back into the mansion, closing the door heavily behind him, which had a painted image of the God of Wealth pasted on it.

The process of delivering the letters was also uneventful. The house on the corner of Taoye Lane belonged to a family with little fame. An elderly person with a kind face opened the door. After receiving the letter, he smiled and said, "Young man, you've worked hard. Do you want to come in and rest, have some hot water?"

The young boy smiled shyly, shook his head, and ran away.

The old man gently put the family letter into his sleeve and did not hurry back to his house. He looked into the distance with a cloudy gaze.

His gaze moved from high to low, from far to near, staring at the peach trees on both sides of the street. The seemingly senile and confused old man finally squeezed out a smile.

He turned and left.

Not long after, a cute little yellow sparrow landed on a peach tree branch. Its beak pecked, still tender, and it chirped softly.

The last letter to be delivered was to the teacher who taught at the village school. Along the way, Chen Ping'an passed by a fortune-telling stand. A young Taoist priest dressed in old Daoist robes sat upright behind a table. He wore a tall hat resembling a blooming lotus.

When the young Taoist saw the young boy running past, he quickly greeted, "Young man, don't miss out when you pass by. Come and draw a divination stick. I can help you predict fortune and misfortune." Chen Ping'an did not stop but turned his head and waved his hand.

The Taoist priest was persistent, leaning forward and raising his voice, "Young man, in the past, I charged ten wen for divination. Today, I'll make an exception and only charge you three wen! Of course, if you draw an upper-ranked stick, why not add one more wen as a lucky coin? If you're lucky enough to draw a top-ranked stick, then I'll only charge you five wen. How about it?"

Chen Ping'an's footsteps in the distance clearly paused for a moment. The young Taoist priest quickly stood up, seizing the opportunity, and said loudly, "Early in the morning, young man, you're my first customer. I'll be generous and only charge you three wen. If you sit down and draw a stick, I can tell you frankly, I'll write some yellow paper talismans that can bless your ancestors and accumulate yin virtue. With my ability, I won't guarantee that it will bring great wealth and prosperity, but if it can bring 1-2 more blessings, it's worth a try." Chen Ping'an hesitated and turned back, sitting on the bench in front of the stall.

A simple Taoist priest and a shabby young boy, two poor individuals, sat facing each other.

The Taoist priest smiled and extended his hand, indicating for the young boy to pick up the divination cylinder.

Chen Ping'an hesitated and suddenly said, "I won't draw a stick, but can you write a yellow paper talisman for me?"

In Chen Ping'an's memory, it seemed that this wandering young Taoist had been in the town for at least five or six years. His appearance hadn't changed much, and he was always amiable to everyone. He usually helped people with bone reading, face reading, divination, and drawing divination sticks. Occasionally, he even wrote family letters. Interestingly, on the desk was a cylinder containing 108 bamboo divination sticks. Over the years, no one in the town had drawn an upper-ranked stick nor drawn a lower-ranked stick from the cylinder. It seemed as if all 108 sticks were neither bad nor good. So, during festivals and holidays, the townspeople could accept spending ten wen for a good omen, but when faced with troubles, no one would be willing to be a fool here. If this Taoist priest was a complete fraud, it would be unfair to him. The town was small, and if he only knew how to deceive and cheat people, he would have been driven away long ago. Therefore, this young Taoist's true abilities certainly didn't lie in fortune-telling or drawing divination sticks. However, there were some minor illnesses and ailments that could be cured by drinking his talisman water, which proved quite effective.

The young Taoist shook his head and said, "I conduct my business honestly. If we agreed on divination and writing talismans together, it will cost you five wen."

Chen Ping'an whispered back, "It's three wen."The Taoist laughed and said, "If you draw the topmost sign, it will be worth five coins."
Chen Ping'an made up his mind and reached out to take the cylinder. Suddenly, he looked up and asked, "Master, how did you know that I happened to have five coins on me?"
The Taoist sat upright and said, "I can see a person's fortune and wealth accurately."
Chen Ping'an thought for a moment and picked up the cylinder.
The Taoist smiled and said, "Young man, don't be nervous. What is meant to happen will happen, and what is not meant to happen will not, so treat the unpredictable with a calm heart. That is the best way."
Chen Ping'an placed the cylinder back on the table, solemnly, and asked, "Master, I will give you all five coins instead of drawing a sign. Can you please write the yellow paper talisman better than usual? Is that okay?"
The Taoist smiled as usual, pondered for a moment, and nodded, saying, "Alright."
On the table, the writing tools were already prepared. The Taoist carefully asked for Chen Ping'an's parents' names, birthplaces, and dates of birth. He took out a piece of yellow talisman paper and quickly finished writing it in one go.
As for what he wrote, Chen Ping'an had no idea.
Putting down the pen, the young Taoist blew on the ink, "When you bring it back home, stand inside the doorway and burn the yellow paper talisman outside the doorstep."
The young man solemnly accepted the talisman and carefully kept it, not forgetting to place the five copper coins on the table and bow in gratitude.
The young Taoist waved his hand, indicating the young man to go about his business.
Chen Ping'an ran to deliver the final letter.
The Taoist lazily leaned back in his chair and glanced at the copper coins. He bent over and picked them up in his hand.
At that moment, a delicate yellow sparrow flew down from the sky and lightly pecked at one of the copper coins before quickly losing interest and flying away.
"The yellow sparrow intends to pick flowers, but your peach blossom hasn't bloomed yet."
After reciting this poem leisurely, the Taoist sighed and lightly waved his sleeve, saying, "What is destined will happen, so don't force what is not destined."
With this wave of his sleeve, two bamboo slips slipped out from his sleeve and fell to the ground. The Taoist exclaimed and hurriedly picked them up, then cautiously looked around to see if anyone noticed. Once he confirmed that no one paid attention, he relaxed, and hid the two bamboo slips in his loose sleeve. The young Taoist coughed, put on a serious face, and continued to wait for the next customer.
He couldn't help but feel a little emotional. It was indeed easier to make money from women.
In fact, the young Taoist kept two bamboo slips in his sleeve, one representing the best outcome, and the other the worst, both used to earn large sums of money.
It was not necessary to reveal this to outsiders.
The young man naturally didn't know these mysteries. He lightly stepped forward and arrived outside a township school. Nearby, a bamboo forest was lush and green.
Chen Ping'an slowed down and heard the mature voice of a middle-aged man coming from inside the house, "The sun rises brilliantly, and the lamb's fleece is drenched."
Then, a chorus of clear and crisp young voices followed, "The sun rises brilliantly, and the lamb's fleece is drenched."
Chen Ping'an looked up and saw the rising sun, shining brightly.
The young man stared in a daze.
When he came back to his senses, the children of the village school were shaking their heads and practicing a passage according to the teacher's instructions: "As the Awakening of Insects arrives, the heavens and earth become vibrant, and all things begin to flourish. At night, sleep early and wake up early, taking broad steps in the courtyard. A gentleman walks slowly to cultivate ambitions..."
Chen Ping'an stood at the gate of the school, hesitating.
The middle-aged scholar with traces of frost in his sideburns turned to look at him and walked out of the house gently.
Chen Ping'an handed the letter to him with both hands and respectfully said, "This is the teacher's letter."
The tall man in a green robe took the envelope and said warmly, "You can come here to listen quietly when you have nothing to do in the future."
Chen Ping'an felt a bit hesitant. After all, he might not really have the time to come and listen to this teacher. He didn't want to deceive him.
The man smiled, understanding his thoughts, and said, "No worries, the principles are all in the books, but being a good person goes beyond that. You can go now."
Chen Ping'an breathed a sigh of relief, bid farewell, and left.
After running far away, he couldn't help but turn his head and look back.
He saw the teacher still standing at the door, his figure bathed in sunlight, looking like a divine being from afar.Note: This translation used 6611 GPT tokens
