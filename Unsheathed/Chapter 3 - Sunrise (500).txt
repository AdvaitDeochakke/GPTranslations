The town is neither big nor small, with over six hundred households. Chen Pingan is familiar with the doors of the poor families in the town, but as for the wealthy families with solid backgrounds, they are difficult to approach for a commoner like him. Chen Pingan has never even set foot in the wide alleys where the wealthy families gather. The streets there are mostly paved with large pieces of bluestone, so even on rainy days, there is no mud splattered when you step on it. After being trampled by people and carriages for thousands of years, these bluestones have become as smooth as mirrors.

The surnames Lu, Li, Zhao, and Song are considered prominent families in this town. The money for the village school comes from these few families, and they each own two or three large dragon kilns outside the city. The official residence of the supervisor in charge of the kilns is located on the same street as these households.

Unfortunately, almost all of the ten letters that Chen Pingan has to deliver today are to the well-to-do families that this small town is known for. This is reasonable, as the saying goes, "A dragon begets a dragon, a phoenix begets a phoenix, and a mouse's offspring can dig a hole." Those who are able to send letters back home while traveling far away must come from well-off families, otherwise they wouldn't have the confidence to embark on a journey. Among the nine letters, Chen Pingan actually only goes to two places: Fulu Street and Taoye Alley. When he stepped on the bluestone slabs as big as beds for the first time, the young man felt a little uneasy and slowed down his pace. He couldn't help but feel ashamed, thinking that his straw sandals would dirty the street.

The first letter Chen Pingan delivered was to the Lu family, who had received an emperor's jade scepter as a gift from their ancestors. When the young man stood at the door, he became even more restless.In wealthy households, there are many luxuries to be found. The Lu family's mansion is not only large, but it also has two stone lions placed at the entrance. These lions are tall and imposing. Song Jixin said that these ornaments can ward off evil spirits, but Chen Ping'an has no idea what that means. He is simply curious about the round stone balls held in the mouths of the tall lions. How were they carved out? Chen Ping'an restrains his impulse to touch the stone balls and walks up the steps. He knocks on the bronze lion door knocker, and soon a young man opens the door. When he hears that Chen Ping'an is delivering a letter, the young man shows no expression. He uses his two fingers to pinch the corner of the envelope, takes the letter, and quickly walks into the mansion, closing the door heavily behind him with the painted door-god statue on it.

Afterward, the process of delivering the letters is unremarkable. At the corner of Tao Ye Alley, there is a household with an obscure reputation. The person who opens the door is a kind-eyed and benevolent elderly man. After accepting the letter, he smiles and says, "Young man, you've worked hard. Would you like to come in and rest, have a hot drink?" The young man smiles shyly, shakes his head, and runs away.

The old man gently puts the family letter into his sleeve and doesn't rush back to his residence. He looks up into the distance, his gaze unfocused. Finally, his gaze descends from high to low, from far to near, and focuses on the peach trees on both sides of the street. The seemingly senile and muddled old man finally squeezes out a smile. He turns around and leaves.

Not long after, a cute little yellow sparrow lands on a branch of a peach tree. Its beak pecks gently, still tender, and it chirps softly.The last letter to be sent, Chen Ping'an needs to deliver it to the teacher who teaches at the village school. Along the way, he passes by a fortune-telling booth where a young Taoist priest in an old Daoist robe is sitting behind a table with a straight posture. He wears a tall hat, resembling a blooming lotus flower.

When the young Taoist sees the approaching youth, he quickly greets, "Young man, don't miss out as you pass by. Come and draw a divination stick. This humble Taoist can help you predict good and bad luck."

Chen Ping'an doesn't stop his footsteps but turns his head and waves his hand.

The Taoist persists and leans forward, raising his voice, "Young man, in the past, I charged ten copper coins for interpreting divination sticks for others. But today, I'll make an exception and only charge you three copper coins! Of course, if you draw an auspicious stick, you may want to give an extra one copper coin as a joyous offering. And if luck is great and you draw an extremely auspicious stick, this humble Taoist will only charge you five copper coins. How about it?"

From a distance, Chen Ping'an's steps noticeably pause. The young Taoist quickly stands up, striking while the iron is hot, and says loudly, "Early in the morning, you are the first customer, so this humble Taoist will provide good services. As long as you sit down to draw a stick, I won't hide it from you. I will write some talismans on yellow paper to pray for blessings from your ancestors and accumulate good karma. With my abilities, I can't guarantee that it will bring great wealth and high status, but if it can bring 1-2 blessings, it's worth a try." Chen Ping'an hesitates and then turns back, sitting on the bench in front of the booth.

A simple Taoist priest and a poor young man, sitting opposite each other.

The Taoist smiles and extends his hand, signaling for the young man to pick up the divination tube.Chen Ping'an hesitated and suddenly said, "I won't draw lots, can you just write a yellow paper talisman for me, is that okay?"

In Chen Ping'an's memory, it seemed that this young Daoist had been staying in the small town for at least five or six years. His appearance hadn't changed much, and he was always friendly to everyone. He usually helped people with bone fortune-telling, face reading, divination, and occasionally wrote letters on behalf of others. Interestingly, on the desk, there was a bamboo container with one hundred and eight fortune-telling sticks. Over the years, no one in the town had drawn the highest fortune, nor had anyone drawn the lowest fortune. It was as if all one hundred and eight sticks were filled with good fortune.

So, on festive occasions, if people spent ten copper coins just to get some good luck, the townsfolk could accept it. However, when it came to troublesome matters, no one would be willing to be a fool here. If this Daoist were a complete fraud, it would be unfair to accuse him. The town was small, if he was only good at trickery and deception, he would have been driven away long ago. Therefore, it was certain that this young Daoist's abilities were not limited to fortune-telling and writing talismans. However, he was quite effective in curing minor ailments. Many people who drank a bowl of his talisman water would quickly recover.

The young Daoist shook his head and said, "I, as a humble Daoist, always act with honesty. We agreed on both fortune-telling and writing talismans, and it will cost you five copper coins."

Chen Ping'an softly retorted, "It should be three copper coins."

The Daoist laughed and said, "But what if you draw the highest fortune? Then it will be five copper coins."Chen Ping'an made up his mind and reached out to grab the lottery tube. Suddenly, he looked up and asked, "How did you know that I happened to have five wen coins on me?"
The Taoist sat solemnly and replied, "This humble Taoist can accurately assess a person's fortune and wealth. I have always been accurate."
After thinking for a moment, Chen Ping'an picked up the lottery tube.
The Taoist smiled and said, "Young man, don't be nervous. There is a time for everything in one's destiny. If it's not your time yet, don't force it. Treat unforeseen events with equanimity. That is the best way."
Chen Ping'an put the lottery tube back on the table, with a serious expression, and asked, "Taoist, I will give you all five wen coins without drawing the lottery. Can you please write the yellow paper talisman with better runes than usual?"
The Taoist smiled as usual, pondered for a moment, and nodded, "Sure."
On the table, ink, brush, inkstone, and paper were already prepared. The Taoist carefully asked for the names, birthplaces, and birthdays of Chen Ping'an's parents, and quickly finished writing on a yellow piece of paper in one breath.
As for what was written, Chen Ping'an had no idea.
After putting down the brush and picking up the talisman, the young Taoist blew on the ink, saying, "When you bring it home, stand at the threshold and burn the yellow paper outside the door."
The young man solemnly accepted the talisman, treasured it carefully, and did not forget to leave the five copper coins on the table before bowing and expressing his gratitude.
The young Taoist waved his hand, indicating the young man to go about his own business.
Chen Ping'an ran off to deliver his last letter.
The Taoist lazily leaned back in his chair, glanced at the copper coins, and bent down to pick them up in his hand.Just at this moment, a small and delicate yellow sparrow flew down from the sky and lightly pecked at a copper coin on the table. Quickly losing interest, it spread its wings and flew away.

"The yellow sparrow desires to carry flowers in its beak, but your family's peach blossoms have not yet bloomed."

After reciting this poem with ease, the Daoist sighed, pretending to be laid-back as he lightly waved his sleeve, saying, "In life, one can only strive for what is within reach and not seek what is unattainable."

With a wave of his sleeve, two bamboo sticks slipped out from his sleeve and fell to the ground. The Daoist exclaimed and hastily picked them up. He then looked around cautiously and, seeing that no one was paying attention, he felt relieved and hid the two bamboo sticks in the loose cuff of his sleeve. The young Daoist cleared his throat, put on a serious face, and continued to stand by the tree, waiting for the next visitor.

He couldn't help but feel a bit emotional; it was indeed easier to earn money from women.

In fact, the two bamboo sticks hidden in the young Daoist's sleeve were the top and bottom fortune sticks, both used to make big money.

It's not to be told to outsiders.

The young man naturally didn't understand these mysterious secrets. As he walked lightly, he arrived outside a village school. The nearby bamboo forest was lush and brimming with greenery.

Chen Ping'an slowed down his pace, and from inside the house came the deep voice of a middle-aged man, "The sun rising casts brilliant rays, and the lamb fur glistens with dew."

Then, a clear and crisp childish voice chimed in, "The sun rising casts brilliant rays, and the lamb fur glistens with dew."

Chen Ping'an looked up, the rising sun shining grandly and magnificently.

The young man was momentarily stunned.

When he came to his senses, he saw the school children shaking their heads and reciting a passage as instructed by their teacher: "In the time of Jingzhe, the heavens and the earth awaken, and all things begin to flourish. Sleeping at night and rising early, take wide strides in the courtyard. A gentleman walks slowly to facilitate clarity of mind..."Chen Pingan stood at the entrance of the academy, hesitant to speak.
A middle-aged Confucian scholar with a hint of gray in his temples turned his head and walked out of the house gently.
Chen Pingan handed over the letter with both hands, respectfully saying, "This is Master's letter."
The tall man in a green robe took the envelope and kindly said, "You can come here to listen often when you have nothing else to do."
Chen Pingan felt a bit embarrassed, as he might not truly have the time to come and listen to this master teach. The young man didn't want to deceive him.
The man smiled, understanding his predicament, and said, "It's alright. The principles are all in the books, but being a good person goes beyond that. You can go on with your tasks."
Chen Pingan breathed a sigh of relief and bid farewell before leaving.
After running far away, the young man turned back unconsciously.
He saw that the master was still standing at the entrance, his figure bathed in sunlight, from afar, as if he were a deity.Note: This translation used 7001 GPT tokens
