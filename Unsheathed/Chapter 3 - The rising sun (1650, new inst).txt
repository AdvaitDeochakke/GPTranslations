The town was neither big nor small, with over six hundred households. Chen Ping'an recognized most of the poor families in the town, but the wealthy families with solid backgrounds were a different story. The threshold was high, and a commoner like Chen Ping'an couldn't step into those spacious alleyways where the rich families gathered. The streets there were paved with large green stone slabs, so even on rainy days, one wouldn't step into mud and splash it around. These excellent quality green stone slabs had been smoothed as mirrors over the centuries by the trampling of people and carriages.

The surnames Lu, Li, Zhao, and Song were prominent in the town. The money for the village school came from these families, and they each owned two to three large dragon kilns outside the city. The official residences of the kiln supervisors throughout the years were on the same street as these households.

Unfortunately, almost all of the ten letters Chen Ping'an had to deliver today were going to the well-off families known in the town. This was reasonable since "a dragon gives birth to a dragon, a phoenix gives birth to a phoenix, and a rat's child knows how to burrow." A traveler who could send letters back home from afar must come from a well-off family, or else they wouldn't have the confidence to travel. Out of these nine letters, Chen Ping'an was actually headed to only two places: Fulu Street and Taoye Lane. When he first stepped onto the green stone slabs as large as beds, the youth felt somewhat anxious. He slowed down his steps, feeling somewhat embarrassed and even thought his straw shoes had dirtied the street.

The first letter Chen Ping'an delivered was to the Lu family, who had received an imperial jade scepter as a gift from the emperor in ancestral times. Standing at the door, the youth became even more uneasy.

Rich families appreciated grandeur, and the Lu family not only had a large mansion but also two stone lions placed at their doorstep. The lions were tall and imposing. Song Jixin said that these things could ward off evil spirits. Chen Ping'an had no idea what evil spirits were, but he was curious about the sphere held in the mouth of the taller lion. How was it carved? Chen Ping'an resisted the urge to touch the stone sphere and walked up the steps to knock on the bronze lion's head knocker. Soon, a young man opened the door and, upon hearing that Chen Ping'an was delivering a letter, took it without expression. He pinched a corner of the envelope with his fingers and then quickly walked into the mansion, shutting the door heavily, which was adorned with a painted statue of the God of Wealth.

The subsequent letter deliveries were equally uneventful. At the corner of Taoye Lane, a little-known family opened the door. An elderly person with a kind face accepted the letter and smiled, saying, "Young man, you've worked hard. Would you like to come in and rest, have some hot water?"

The youth smiled shyly, shook his head, and ran away.

The old person gently put the letter in their sleeve and didn't rush back to their residence. They looked into the distance with a hazy gaze.

From high to low, from afar to near, their gaze focused on the peach trees on both sides of the street. Seemingly senile and dull, the old person finally squeezed out a smile.

The old person turned and left.

Not long after, a cute yellow finch landed on a peach tree branch. Its beak pecked softly, and it chirped lightly.

The last letter that remained was to be delivered to the teacher who taught at the village school. Along the way, Chen Ping'an passed by a fortune-telling stall. There sat a young Taoist priest in an old Daoist robe, sitting upright with a high hat on his head like a blooming lotus.

When the young Taoist saw Chen Ping'an running past, he quickly greeted him, "Young man, don't pass by without stopping. Come draw a divination stick. This humble Daoist will help you divine your fortune and predict good or bad luck for you."

Chen Ping'an didn't stop his steps but turned his head and waved his hand.

The Taoist priest didn't give up and leaned forward, raising his voice, "Young man, in the past, this humble Daoist would charge ten wen for divination stick readings. But today, I'll make an exception and only charge you three wen! Of course, if you draw a top-quality stick, you may consider adding an extra wen as a symbol of joy. And if it's an extremely auspicious sign, a superlative sign, this humble Daoist will only charge you five wen. How about it?"

Chen Ping'an's footsteps in the distance clearly paused for a moment. The young Taoist promptly stood up, seizing the opportunity, and said loudly, "Early in the morning, you're the first customer, so I'll be generous. Sit down and draw a stick. To be honest, this humble Daoist will write some yellow paper talismans for you, which can help pray for blessings for your ancestors, accumulate Yin virtue. With this humble Daoist's ability, I can't promise that it'll make you extremely wealthy, but I can guarantee an extra 1-2 blessings. It's worth a try." Chen Ping'an hesitated for a moment, then turned back and sat on the stool in front of the stall.

A plain Taoist priest and a poor youth sat facing each other, two poverty-stricken souls. The Taoist smiled and extended his hand, indicating for the youth to pick up the divination stick.

Chen Ping'an hesitated, then suddenly said, "I won't draw a stick. Can you just write a yellow paper talisman for me?"

In Chen Ping'an's memory, this wandering young Taoist had already been in the town for at least five to six years. His appearance hadn't changed much, always amiable to everyone. Usually, he helped people by reading faces, divining fortunes, and drawing divination sticks. Occasionally, he even wrote letters. What was interesting was that on the table before him, there was a cylinder that held 108 bamboo divination sticks. Over the years, no one in town had drawn a top-quality stick, nor had anyone ever drawn a bottom-quality stick from the cylinder, as if all 108 sticks were neither bad nor good.Therefore, during holidays and festivals, the townsfolk would willingly spend ten wen to seek good luck. However, if they were faced with troubles, no one would willingly be a scapegoat. It would be an injustice to call this Taoist priest a complete fraud. The town is not that big, if all he did was deceive and cheat, he would have been driven out long ago. Therefore, this young Taoist must possess some real skills, not just in fortune-telling and divination. Rather, he seems to be especially effective in healing minor ailments. Many people who drank his symbolic water would quickly recover from their illnesses, which was quite miraculous.

The young Taoist shook his head and said, "I am an honest person. I charge five wen for both fortune-telling and writing symbols."

Chen Ping'an whispered in response, "It's three wen."

The Taoist laughed and said, "Well, what if you draw an exceptionally good fortune? Then it would be worth five wen."

Chen Ping'an made up his mind and reached out to pick up the divination tube. Suddenly, he looked up and asked, "Master, how did you know I had exactly five wen?"

The Taoist sat upright and said, "I can see a person's fortune, whether it is thick or thin, and how much wealth they possess. I have always been accurate."

Chen Ping'an pondered for a moment and picked up the tube.

The Taoist smiled and said, "Young man, don't be nervous. If it's your destiny, it will come. If it's not, don't force it. Treat uncertain matters with an ordinary heart, that's the best approach."

Chen Ping'an put the tube back on the table, looking serious, and asked, "Master, I will give you all five wen, but I won't draw the divination. Can you please write the yellow paper talisman better than usual?"

The Taoist maintained his usual smile, pondered briefly, and nodded, saying, "Ok."

On the table, the ink, brush, inkstone, and paper were already prepared. The Taoist carefully asked for the names, birthplaces, and birth dates of Chen Ping'an's parents, and then quickly wrote on a yellow paper, completing it effortlessly.

As for what he wrote, Chen Ping'an had no idea.

Putting down the brush and picking up the talisman, the young Taoist blew on its ink marks and said, "When you take it home, stand inside the doorstep and burn the yellow paper outside the doorstep."

The youth solemnly took the talisman, treasuring it carefully, but didn't forget to leave five copper coins on the table and bow in gratitude.

The young Taoist waved his hand, signaling the young man to go about his business.

Chen Ping'an ran off to deliver his last letter.

The Taoist lazily leaned back in his chair, glanced at the copper coins, and leaned forward to collect them.

At that moment, a petite yellow sparrow swooped down onto the table from above, pecked one of the copper coins lightly, then quickly lost interest and flew away.

"When the yellow sparrow begins to peck flowers, it means the peach blossom in your home has not yet blossomed."

After reciting this poem leisurely, the Taoist sighed and said, "In life, you can only achieve what is fated for you, not more."

With a wave of his sleeve, two bamboo divination sticks slipped out, falling to the ground. The Taoist exclaimed and quickly picked them up, then looked around surreptitiously. Seeing that no one was paying attention to this side at the moment, he felt relieved and hid the two divination sticks in the loose cuff of his robe. The young Taoist coughed and put on a serious face, ready to wait for his next customer.

He couldn't help but reflect that it was indeed easier to earn money from women.

Actually, the two divination sticks hidden in the young Taoist's sleeve were used to make a lot of money.

It's not something that outsiders need to know about.

The young man, of course, had no idea about these mysterious secrets. Light-footed, he arrived outside a village school, surrounded by lush bamboo forests, vibrant and dripping with green.

With a slower pace, Chen Ping'an approached the schoolhouse. A middle-aged scholar's rich and deep voice echoed from inside, "The sunrise is bright, and the lamb's fleece is wet."

Then, a crisp and tender voice followed, "The sunrise is bright, and the lamb's fleece is wet."

Chen Ping'an looked up and saw the rising sun, magnificent and majestic.

The young boy was entranced.

After he snapped out of it, the children in the school were shaking their heads and reciting a passage according to the teacher's instructions: "With the arrival of spring thunder, the heavens and earth come alive, and all things begin to flourish. Sleep early and rise early, take broad steps in the courtyard. A nobleman walks slowly to cultivate enthusiasm..."

Chen Ping'an stood at the entrance of the school, hesitating to speak.

The middle-aged Confucian scholar with a few streaks of frost in his hair turned his head and looked gently at him, then walked out of the house.

Chen Ping'an respectfully handed over the letter, saying, "This is a letter from Sir."

The tall man in a blue robe took the envelope and said warmly, "When you have free time, you can come here to listen."

Chen Ping'an felt a little embarrassed. After all, he might not have the time to come and listen to this gentleman teach. He didn't want to deceive him.

The man smiled, understanding his predicament, and said kindly, "It's alright. The principles are all in the books, but being a good person goes beyond books. You can go and busy yourself now."

Chen Ping'an breathed a sigh of relief and bid farewell.

After running quite a distance away, he turned his head back as if compelled by some mysterious force.

The gentleman was still standing at the entrance, bathed in sunlight, and from a distance, he seemed almost godlike.Note: This translation used 6821 GPT tokens
