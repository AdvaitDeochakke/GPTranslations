      "On the second day of the second month, the dragon raises its head.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the twilight, in a quiet corner of a small town called Niping Lane, there was a lonely and thin young man. Following the customs, he held a candle in one hand and a peach branch in the other, shining it on the beams, walls, and wooden beds, tapping and knocking with the peach branch, trying to drive away snakes, scorpions, centipedes, and other creatures. He muttered something in his mouth, an old saying passed down through generations in this town: \"On the second day of the second month, the candle illuminates the beams, the peach strikes the wall, and there is no place for snakes and insects in the mortal realm.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man's surname was Chen and his name was Ping'an. His parents had passed away early. The town was famous for its porcelain, and since the founding of the dynasty, it had taken on the important task of \"burning sacrificial vessels for the imperial tomb\", with imperial officials stationed here to supervise the affairs of the official kilns. As a young man with no one to rely on, he had long been working as a kiln craftsman, starting with odd jobs and heavy work. He had followed a master with a bad temper for several years. Just when he had finally grasped some techniques of porcelain making, the world changed. The town suddenly lost the protection of the official kilns, and dozens of kilns resembling sleeping dragons in the surrounding area were ordered to be closed overnight by the government.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chen Ping'an put down the newly folded peach branch, blew out the candle, and walked out of the house. Sitting on the steps, he looked up at the sparkling starry sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man still vividly remembered the old master, who only acknowledged him as a half apprentice. His surname was Yao, and last autumn, he was found sitting on a small bamboo chair, facing the direction of the kiln, with his eyes closed.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there were only a few people like old Yao who were so stubborn. The craftsmen in the town, who had only been skilled in porcelain making for generations, did not dare to exceed the production of tribute kilns, nor did they dare to sell the stored porcelain to the common people without authorization. They had to seek other ways to make a living. The 14-year-old Chen Ping'an was also expelled from the town and returned to Niping Lane, continuing to guard this dilapidated old house. It was almost a scene of destitution with empty walls. Even if Chen Ping'an wanted to be a prodigal son, he didn't know where to start.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having been a wandering soul for a while, the young man could not find a way to make money. He relied on his meager savings to barely fill his stomach. A few days ago, he heard that an outsider named Ruan, who was a blacksmith in a street called Dragon Riding Lane several blocks away, was looking to take on seven or eight apprentices. The apprentices would not be paid, but they would be provided with food. Chen Ping'an hurriedly went to try his luck, only to be rejected by the old man with a disdainful glance. At that time, Chen Ping'an was puzzled. Wasn't blacksmithing a trade that valued strength rather than appearance?\n",
      "\n",
      "Although Chen Ping'an looked weak, his strength should not be underestimated. It was the result of years of pottery making, shaping his physical foundation. In addition, Chen Ping'an had followed old Yao, wandering through the mountains and rivers within a hundred miles of the town, tasting the various soils around, willing to do any dirty and tiring work without complaint. Unfortunately, old Yao never liked Chen Ping'an and despised the young man for lacking talent, considering him a blockhead compared to his senior apprentice Liu Xianyang. It was no wonder the old man favored his senior apprentice. The master opens the door, but the cultivation comes from the individual. For example, when it came to the dull and boring pottery shaping, Liu Xianyang's progress in just half a year could match Chen Ping'an's three years of hard work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although Chen Ping'an might not need this skill in his lifetime, he still closed his eyes as usual, imagining that there were green stones and pottery wheels in front of him, and he began practicing pottery shaping, becoming more skilled through practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every quarter of an hour or so, the young man would take a short break, shaking his wrists, repeating this cycle until he was completely exhausted. Then Chen Ping'an would get up, walk in the courtyard, and slowly stretch his muscles and bones. No one had ever taught Chen Ping'an these things; he had figured them out on his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the silence of the world, Chen Ping'an heard a harsh mocking laughter. He stopped walking and, as expected, saw a peer squatting on the top of the wall, sneering without concealing his disdainful expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "This person was Chen Ping'an's old neighbor, rumored to be the illegitimate child of the former supervisor. That supervisor, fearing criticism and impeachment, had returned to the capital alone to report on his work and entrusted the child to the incoming official with a close personal relationship to take care of. Now that the town had inexplicably lost the qualification to produce official kilns, the supervisor responsible for overseeing the kiln affairs for the court had enough trouble protecting himself, let alone caring for the illegitimate child of his colleague. After leaving some money, he hurriedly went to the capital to arrange connections. Unknowingly, the abandoned neighbor had been living a carefree life, wandering around the town with his personal maid, enjoying a leisurely year without ever worrying about money.\n",
      "\n",
      "The low earth walls of every house in Niping Lane did not require the neighbor to tiptoe; he could easily see the scene in this courtyard. But every time he spoke to Chen Ping'an, he liked to squat on the top of the wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared to the plain and vulgar name Chen Ping'an, the neighbor had a much more elegant name, Song Jixin. Even the maidservant who depended on him had a refined name, Zhigui. The girl was now standing on the other side of the courtyard wall, her almond-shaped eyes timid and weak.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other side of the gate, a voice sounded, \"Are you selling this maid?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Song Jixin was stunned for a moment and turned her head towards the voice. It was a young man in brocade clothing with a smiling face, a completely unfamiliar face standing outside the courtyard.\n",

      "A tall old man with fair complexion and a gentle expression stood beside a young man in embroidered clothes. He squinted his eyes and scanned the young boys and girls in the two neighboring courtyards. The old man's gaze passed over Chen Ping'an without stopping, but lingered on Song Jixin and the maidservant, his smile gradually intensifying.\n",
      "\n",
      "Song Jixin narrowed his eyes and said, \"Sell it! Why wouldn't you sell it?\"\n",
      "The young man smiled and said, \"Then you name the price.\"\n",
      "The girl widened her eyes, her face full of confusion, like a young deer in a panic.\n",
      "Song Jixin rolled his eyes and held up a finger, shaking it. \"Ten thousand taels of silver!\"\n",
      "The young man remained calm and nodded. \"Alright.\"\n",
      "Song Jixin saw that the young man did not seem to be joking, so he immediately changed his tune. \"It's ten thousand taels of gold!\"\n",
      "The corner of the young man's mouth curled up. \"Just kidding.\"\n",
      "Song Jixin's face darkened.\n",
      "The young man no longer paid any attention to Song Jixin. He shifted his gaze and looked at Chen Ping'an. \"Thanks to you, I was able to buy that carp today. After buying it, I became more and more delighted the more I looked at it. I thought I must thank you in person, so I asked my grandfather to bring me here overnight to find you.\"\n",
      "He tossed a heavy embroidered bag to Chen Ping'an and said with a radiant smile, \"This is my gratitude. Let's consider us even.\"\n",
      "Chen Ping'an was about to say something, but the young man had already turned and left.\n",
      "Chen Ping'an frowned.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the day, he had inadvertently seen a middle-aged man carrying a fish basket walking on the street, catching a golden carp about the size of a palm. It was jumping vigorously in the bamboo basket, and with just a glance, Chen Ping'an felt a sense of celebration. So he asked if he could buy it for ten coins. The middle-aged man had initially just wanted to reward himself, but seeing the possibility of making a profit, he immediately raised the price and refused to sell unless he was paid thirty coins. Chen Ping'an, who had little money, was unwilling to spend so much, but he was also reluctant to part with the beautiful golden carp. He followed the middle-aged man, trying to negotiate the price down to fifteen or twenty coins. Just as the middle-aged man showed signs of relenting, the young man in embroidered clothes and the tall old man happened to pass by. Without saying a word, they bought the carp and the fish basket for fifty coins. Chen Ping'an could only watch as they walked away, helpless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Staring at the back of the father and son that receded into the distance, Song Jixin withdrew his malicious gaze. He jumped off the wall and seemed to recall something, saying to Chen Ping'an, \"Do you remember the four-legged creature from the first day of the lunar month?\"\n",
      "Chen Ping'an nodded.\n",
      "How could he not remember? It was still vivid in his memory.\n",
      "According to the centuries-old custom in this town, if a snake-like creature enters one's house, it is considered a good omen, and the owner should never drive it away or kill it. Song Jixin was sunbathing on the doorstep on the first day of the lunar month when a small creature, commonly known as a four-legged snake, suddenly crawled into his house under his nose. Song Jixin caught it and threw it into the yard, thinking that would be the end of it. He never expected that the battered and bruised four-legged snake would become even more daring. Time and time again, it pushed Song Jixin, who had never believed in ghosts and gods, to the brink of madness. In a fit of anger, he threw it into Chen Ping'an's yard. Little did he know that the next day, he would find the four-legged snake coiled up under his own bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Song Jixin noticed the girl tugging at his sleeve.\n",
      "As if reading each other's thoughts, the young man held back the words that were already on the tip of his tongue.\n",
      "What he wanted to say was that recently, the incredibly ugly four-legged snake had developed a bump on its forehead, resembling a horn.\n",
      "Song Jixin instead said, \"Zhengui and I might leave this place next month.\"\n",
      "Chen Ping'an sighed, \"Be careful on the road.\"\n",
      "Song Jixin half seriously and half jokingly said, \"There are some things that I definitely can't take with me. Don't take advantage of the fact that no one is home and steal things.\"\n",
      "Chen Ping'an shook his head.\n",
      "Song Jixin suddenly burst into laughter, pointing at Chen Ping'an with his finger, teasingly saying, \"Timid as a mouse, no wonder the poor are taken advantage of. Not only in this life will you be impoverished, maybe it will continue in the next life too.\"\n",
      "Chen Ping'an remained silent.\n",
      "They each went back to their rooms. Chen Ping'an closed the door and lay on the hard wooden bed. The impoverished young boy closed his eyes and whispered softly, \"Safe, peaceful, safe, peaceful, safe, peaceful...\"\n",

      "It was just starting to get light, and the rooster hadn't crowed yet, but Chen Ping'an was already up. The thin bedding couldn't retain the heat, and Chen Ping'an had developed the habit of waking up early and staying up late when he was an apprentice in the porcelain kiln. He opened the door and stepped into the soft courtyard, took a deep breath, stretched lazily, walked out of the yard, and turned his head to see a slender figure bending over, carrying a wooden bucket of water with both hands, and using her shoulders to push open the door of her own courtyard. It was Song Jixin, a maidservant from Songjiya, who had just returned from fetching water from the Iron Lock Well in Xinghua Lane.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chen Ping'an averted his gaze, crossed streets and alleys, and ran to the east side of the town. Niping Lane was to the west of the town, and the easternmost gate was responsible for the entry and exit of merchants and the night patrol. Usually, they also collected and delivered some letters sent from outside. The next thing Chen Ping'an had to do was to deliver those letters to the townspeople. The reward was one letter and one copper coin. This was a hard-earned source of income that Chen Ping'an had worked hard to find. He had already made an appointment with them to take over this job after the Long Tai Head event in February. \n",
      "\n",
      "In Song Jixin's words, it was his destiny to be poor and even if he had the fortune to enter the household, Chen Ping'an couldn't hold on to it. Song Jixin often said some obscure and difficult-to-understand words, perhaps taken from books. Chen Ping'an never quite understood them. For example, a couple of days ago, Song Jixin kept mentioning something about the harsh cold of early spring freezing young people to death. Chen Ping'an didn't understand it at all. As for experiencing colder weather after surviving the winter and entering spring, Chen Ping'an had a personal understanding. Song Jixin said it was called \"Reverse Spring Cold\" and was as deadly as the bayonet charge on the battlefield, so many people would die at these ghostly checkpoints.\n",
      "\n",
      "The town was not surrounded by city walls, as there were few bandits or thieves, not to mention bandits and thieves. So, in name, it was a city gate, but in reality, it was a row of old and crooked fences. It was enough to let pedestrians and vehicles pass through, which was considered the face of the town.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Chen Ping'an ran past Apricot Blossom Lane, he saw many women and children gathering by the Iron Lock Well, and the pulley of the well was squeaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "After passing through another street, Chen Ping'an heard a familiar sound of reading not far away. There was a rural school there, which was jointly funded by several large households in the town. The school teacher was from outside the town. When Chen Ping'an was young, he often ran to hide outside the window and secretly eavesdrop, his ears perked up. Although that teacher was strict when teaching, he didn't scold or stop Chen Ping'an and the other children who were \"free readers and learners\". After Chen Ping'an went to work as an apprentice in a dragon kiln outside the town, he never went to the school again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving forward, Chen Ping'an passed by a stone archway. The archway had twelve stone pillars, and the locals liked to call it the \"Crab Archway\" because of the twelve pillars. The real name of this archway, according to Song Jixin and Liu Yangxian, was quite different. Song Jixin confidently said that in an old book called the \"Local County Chronicles\", it was called the \"Grand Scholar Archway\" and was a plaque gifted by the emperor himself to commemorate the achievements of a high-ranking official in history. Liu Yangxian, who was as naïve as Chen Ping'an, said it was the Crab Archway, which had been called that for hundreds of years. Why would it be called the nonsensical Grand Scholar Archway? Liu Yangxian also asked Song Jixin, \"How big is the official hat of the Grand Scholar? Is it bigger than the wellhead of the Iron Lock Well?\" This question made Song Jixin's face flush with embarrassment.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this time, Chen Ping'an ran a circle around the twelve-foot archway, with four words on each side, each with a different font, namely \"Do Not Hesitate\", \"Words Come Naturally\", \"Do Not Seek Externally,\" and \"Rage Like Fighting Bulls\". According to Song Jixin, except for those four words, the other three plaques were once tampered with and altered. Chen Ping'an didn't understand any of this and never thought deeply about it. Of course, even if the young man wanted to dig deeper, it would be in vain. He didn't even know what book the \"Local County Chronicles\", which Song Jixin often mentioned, really was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not far after passing the archway, Chen Ping'an soon saw an old pagoda tree with lush branches and leaves. Under the tree, there was a tree trunk that had been brought and roughly chopped by someone. Two pieces of bluestone were placed underneath on both ends, and this segment of the big tree became a simple bench. During the summer, the townsfolk liked to sit here and enjoy the cool breeze. Wealthier families would even fetch a basket of chilled fruits from the well, and the children would eat and drink to their hearts' content, forming groups and playing under the shade of the tree. Chen Ping'an was accustomed to going up the mountains and down to the waters. He ran near the gate, and stopped at the lonely yellow clay door of the house, his heart steady and his breathing calm.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were not many outsiders coming in and out of the town, so logically speaking, with the collapse of the official kiln, there would be even fewer new faces. When Old Yao was alive, he drank too much one time and told Chen Ping'an and Liu Yangxian, his apprentices, that the official kiln business they were involved in was unique in the world. They made porcelain for the emperor and empress. Even if other common people were rich or even held high positions, if they dared to touch it, they would be beheaded. Old Yao was in an unusually good spirit that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, Chen Ping'an looked outside the fence and found many people waiting for the city gate to open, at least seven or eight of them, men, women, and children. And they were all strangers. The local people of the town rarely used the East Gate for their comings and goings. The reason was simple, the road leading out from the town's East Gate didn't have any dragon kilns or fields.\n",

      "At this moment, Chen Ping'an and the outsiders faced each other across a wooden fence. The young boy, wearing homemade grass shoes, couldn't help but envy the thick clothes worn by those people. They must be warm and could endure the cold. \n",
      "The people outside the gate seemed to be divided into several groups, not all belonging together. However, they all looked toward the slim youth inside the gate. Most of them wore expressionless faces, but occasionally one or two individuals would look past the youth's figure and gaze further into the town. \n",
      "Chen Ping'an was puzzled. Did these people not know that the court had already banned all dragon kilns? Or did they know the truth and see an opportunity to exploit it? \n",
      "A young man wearing a peculiar high crown and a slender figure, with a green jade pendant hanging from his waist, seemed impatient. He walked out of the crowd alone and was about to push open the unlocked gate of the fence. However, just as his fingers were about to touch the wooden door, he suddenly stopped, slowly retracted his hand, and crossed it behind his back, smiling at the grass-shoed youth inside the gate without saying a word. \n",
      "Chen Ping'an's peripheral vision caught a glimpse of the people behind the young man. Some seemed disappointed, some curious, some frowned, and some mocked. Their emotions were subtle and varied. \n",
      "Just then, a middle-aged man with messy hair suddenly opened the door and scolded Chen Ping'an, \"You little bastard, have you lost your mind? Are you here so early to collect souls? Hurry up and reincarnate to see your dead parents, huh?!\" \n",
      "Chen Ping'an rolled his eyes and didn't take these sarcastic words to heart. First, living in a rural place with very few books, he didn't get bothered easily by people scolding him. It would be easier for him to just jump into a well and save himself the trouble. Second, the middle-aged gatekeeper himself was often made fun of and teased by the townspeople, especially by those bold and daring women. Not only would they scold him, but some even physically fought with him. Moreover, this man loved boasting to children who wore crotch pants. For example, he would brag about how he had once fought fiercely at the city gate, beating up five or six strong men, leaving them searching for their teeth all over the ground. The road in front of the city gate, which was two zhang wide, was covered in blood, much like a muddy road after rain. \n",
      "Unimpressed with Chen Ping'an, he replied, \"We'll talk about your trivial matters later.\" \n",
      "No one in the town took this guy seriously. But when it came to whether the outsiders could enter the town, the men held the power of life and death. \n",
      "He walked towards the gate of the wooden fence, all the while reaching into his crotch. \n",
      "The man, with his back facing Chen Ping'an, occasionally collected small embroidered bags from people after opening the gate. He would put them in his sleeve, one by one, as he allowed them to pass through. \n",
      "Chen Ping'an had long made way for them. The eight people roughly divided into five groups and walked towards the town. Besides the young man with the high crown and the green pendant, two seven or eight-year-old children also passed by. The boy wore a festive red robe, while the girl had a delicate and tender appearance, resembling a high-quality porcelain doll. \n",
      "The boy was more than half a head shorter than Chen Ping'an. When the child passed by him, he opened his mouth, although no sound came out, but his lips clearly formed words, most likely words of provocation. \n",
      "The middle-aged woman who was leading the boy coughed gently, and the child slightly restrained himself. \n",
      "Behind the middle-aged woman and the boy, an elderly man with snowy white hair led the little girl. She turned and said a long string of words to Chen Ping'an, while also pointing and gesturing to the boy in front of her. \n",
      "Chen Ping'an couldn't understand what the girl was saying, but he could guess that she was tattling on him. \n",
      "The burly old man glanced at the grass-shoed youth, who had been glanced at intentionally or unintentionally by others, and Chen Ping'an instinctively took a step back. \n",
      "Like a mouse seeing a cat. \n",
      "Seeing this scene, the previously chirpy little girl, resembling a yellow bird, abruptly lost interest in stirring up trouble. She turned her head and didn't bother to look at Chen Ping'an again, as if one more glance would dirty her eyes. \n",
      "Chen Ping'an may not have seen much of the world, but it didn't mean he couldn't understand expressions. \n",
      "After the group of people had gone far, the gatekeeper laughed and asked, \"Do you want to know what they said?\" \n",
      "Chen Ping'an nodded, \"Yes.\" \n",
      "The middle-aged man chuckled, \"They were praising how good-looking you are. It was all compliments.\" \n",
      "Chen Ping'an twitched his mouth, thinking, do you really think I'm that foolish? \n",
      "Seeing through the young boy's thoughts, the man laughed even more joyously. \"If you're not stupid, can I ask you to deliver some letters?\" \n",
      "Chen Ping'an didn't dare to argue, fearing that he would anger this guy and lose the money that was about to be in his hands. \n",
      "The man turned his head and looked at the people, rubbing his stubbled chin and murmuring, \"That woman from earlier could crush a person with her thighs.\" \n",
      "Chen Ping'an hesitated for a moment and curiously asked, \"Did that lady practice martial arts?\" \n",
      "The man was shocked and looked down at the young boy, saying seriously, \"You're really clueless, kid.\" \n",
      "The boy was utterly confused. \n",
      "He asked Chen Ping'an to wait and strode towards the house. When he came back, he had a stack of envelopes in his hand, not thick nor thin, about ten of them. After handing them to Chen Ping'an, he asked, \"Fools have good fortune, and good people have good karma. Do you believe that?\" \n",
      "Chen Ping'an held the letters in one hand and spread his palm, blinking his eyes. \"We agreed on one letter for one penny.\" \n",
      "The man became angry and ashamed, forcefully slapping five coins into the young boy's palm. He then waved his hand grandly and said, \"The rest, you owe me five pennies!\"\n",

      "The town was neither big nor small, with over six hundred households. Chen Ping'an was familiar with the poor families in the town, but the wealthy families were inaccessible to him. Some of the well-off families gathered in spacious alleys, which Chen Ping'an had never set foot in. The streets there were paved with large, smooth bluestones that did not turn into mud when it rained. These bluestones, after being walked on by people and vehicles for thousands of years, had become as smooth as mirrors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The surnames Lu, Li, Zhao, and Song were prominent in the town. The money for the local school came from these families, and they owned two to three large dragon kilns outside the city. The official residences of the kiln supervisors were located on the same street as these families.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, almost all of the ten letters Chen Ping'an had to deliver today were for well-known prosperous families in the town. It was reasonable since those who could afford to travel far from home to send letters must come from wealthy families. Among the nine letters, Chen Ping'an only went to two places: Fulu Street and Taoye Lane. When he first stepped on the bluestones as large as beds, the young boy felt a bit anxious and slowed down his pace. Surprisingly, he even felt a sense of self-shame, thinking that his grass shoes had dirtied the streets.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first letter Chen Ping'an delivered was to the Lu family, who had received an emperor's gift of a jade Ruyi scepter in the past. Standing at their doorstep, the young boy became even more nervous.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rich families liked to display their wealth, and apart from the grand size of the Lu family's mansion, there were also two stone lions placed at the entrance, imposing and majestic. Song Jixin had said that these things could ward off evil spirits, but Chen Ping'an had no idea what evil spirits were. He was just curious about the round stone balls in the mouths of the tall lions. How were they carved? Chen Ping'an resisted the urge to touch the stone ball, climbed the stairs, and knocked on the door with the bronze lion's head. Soon, a young man opened the door. When he heard that Chen Ping'an was there to deliver a letter, the man's expression remained unchanged. He used two fingers to pinch the corner of the envelope, took the letter, and quickly walked back into the mansion, closing the door heavily behind him, which had a painted statue of the God of Wealth on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of the letter deliveries by the young boy were just as ordinary. When he arrived at the corner of Taoye Lane, he was greeted by a kind-looking elderly man from an unknown family. After receiving the letter, the old man smiled and said, \"Young man, you've worked hard. Do you want to come in and rest, have a cup of hot water?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The young boy smiled shyly, shook his head, and ran off.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man gently put the letter into his sleeve and didn't hurry back to his house. He looked into the distance, his gaze hazy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, his gaze moved from high to low, from far to near, and settled on the peach trees lining the street. The seemingly confused old man squeezed out a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he turned and walked away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not long after, a cute little yellow bird landed on a branch of a peach tree. Its beak pecked at the tender leaves, chirping softly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last letter that Chen Ping'an needed to deliver was to the teacher at the local school. On the way, he passed by a fortune-telling stall where a young Taoist priest in old Daoist robes sat upright behind a table. He wore a tall hat that resembled a blooming lotus flower.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the young Taoist priest saw the young boy running past, he quickly greeted him, \"Young man, don't miss your chance. Come and draw a divination stick. I can help you predict your fortune.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Chen Ping'an didn't stop but turned his head and waved his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Taoist priest persisted, leaning forward and raising his voice, \"Young man, in the past, I charged ten coins for a divination, but today I'll make an exception and only ask for three coins from you! Of course, if you draw a top-ranked stick, you may want to give an extra coin as a lucky gift. And if it's a truly auspicious sign, I will only charge you five coins. How about it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Chen Ping'an's footsteps hesitated for a moment in the distance. The young Taoist priest quickly stood up, seizing the opportunity. He loudly said, \"It's early in the morning, and you're my first customer. I'm going to be generous and only ask for three coins from you. If you sit down and draw a divination stick, I can write some yellow talisman characters for you, which can pray for blessings from your ancestors and accumulate virtue. With my abilities, I won't dare to say that it will bring you great wealth and fortune, but if it can bring you 1-2 extra blessings, it's worth a try.\" Chen Ping'an hesitated for a moment and then turned back, sitting on the bench in front of the stall.\n",

      "So if it's a holiday or festival and the townsfolk spend ten copper coins just to have good luck, that's acceptable. But if they encounter any troubles, no one would be willing to be a fool. If this Taoist priest is a complete fraud, it would be unfair to him. This town is small, if he could only deceive people and cheat, he would have been thrown out long ago. So this young Taoist's abilities must be more than just fortune telling and divination. However, when it comes to minor ailments, many people who drink the priest's symbol water recover quickly, which is quite effective.\n",

      "As for what he wrote, Chen Ping'an had no idea.\n",
