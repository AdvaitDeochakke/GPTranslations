      "Chapter 1 - Startled Awakening\n",
      "On the second day of the second month, the dragon awakens.\n",
      "In the twilight, in a quiet place called Mud Bottle Alley, there is a lonely and thin young man. At this moment, he is following the tradition, holding a candle in one hand and a peach branch in the other, shining on the beams, walls, wooden bed, and other places, using the peach branch to tap and drive away snakes, scorpions, centipedes, etc. He mutters words in his mouth, an old saying passed down through generations in this town: \"On the second day of the second month, the candle illuminates the beams, the peach strikes the walls, nowhere for the snakes and insects to hide in this world.\"\n",
      "The young man's surname is Chen, his given name is Ping'an, and his parents passed away early. The porcelain of this small town is highly renowned. Since the founding of the dynasty, it has taken up the important task of \"burning sacrificial vessels for the mausoleum as ordered by the court.\" Officials of the imperial court are stationed in this place, overseeing the affairs of the official kiln. The young man, with no relatives or support, started working as a kiln worker for porcelain at a young age. At first, he could only do odd jobs and rough work, following a master with a terrible temper. After toiling for several years, he has just grasped some knowledge of firing porcelain. However, things change unexpectedly, and the town suddenly lost this protective charm of having the official kiln office. Dozens of kilns resembling lying dragons around the town were all ordered to shut down overnight by the government.\n",
      "Chen Ping'an put down the newly cut peach branch, blew out the candle, and walked out of the house. He sat on the steps, looking up at the sparkling starry sky.\n",
      "To this day, the young man still vividly remembers his old master, Master Yao, who would only acknowledge him as a half-apprentice. Last year's late autumn morning, someone found Master Yao sitting on a small bamboo chair, facing the direction of the kiln, with his eyes closed.\n",
      "However, people like Master Yao, who stubbornly adhere to their own beliefs, are ultimately few in number.\n",
      "For generations, the craftsmen in this small town only knew how to make porcelain. They did not dare to surpass the production of tribute pottery for the imperial kiln, nor did they dare to secretly sell their collection of porcelain to the common people. Therefore, they had no choice but to seek alternative paths. At the age of 14, Chen Ping'an was also kicked out of the house and returned to Mud Jar Alley. He continued to guard this dilapidated old house, which was almost empty and desolate. Even if Chen Ping'an wanted to squander his wealth, he wouldn't know where to start.\n",
      "\n",
      "After wandering as a lonely ghost for a while, the young man couldn't find a way to make money. He barely managed to fill his stomach with his meager savings. A few days ago, he heard that a blacksmith named Ruan from Dragon Rider Lane, a few streets away, was looking for seven or eight apprentices. He wouldn't pay them, but would provide meals. Chen Ping'an hurriedly went to try his luck. Unexpectedly, the old man only glanced at him sideways and shut him out. At that time, Chen Ping'an was confused. Wasn't being a blacksmith about strength rather than appearance?\n",
      "It is important to know that although Chen Ping'an appears weak, his strength should not be underestimated. This is the foundation of his body that he developed through years of pottery making and pottery wheel exercises during his youth. In addition, Chen Ping'an also followed an old man surnamed Yao, exploring the mountains and rivers within a hundred li radius of the town and tasting the various flavors of the surrounding soil. He was willing to do any dirty and tiring work without any complaints. Unfortunately, Old Yao never liked Chen Ping'an, finding the young man lacking in intelligence and slower to learn compared to his senior disciple Liu Xianyang. It's not surprising that the old man showed favoritism, as the master can guide the disciple, but cultivation depends on the individual. For example, although both pottery making and wheel exercises are dull and tiresome, Liu Xianyang's progress in just half a year equals the level of Chen Ping'an's three years of hard work.\n",
      "Although Chen Ping'an may not need this skill in his lifetime, he still closes his eyes and imagines a green stone slab and a potter's wheel in front of him, practicing pottery making as usual. He believes that practice makes perfect.\n",
      "Approximately every quarter of an hour, the young man takes a short rest, shakes his wrist, and repeats this cycle until he is completely exhausted. Then, Chen Ping'an stands up, walks in the courtyard, and stretches his muscles and bones slowly. No one has ever taught Chen Ping'an these techniques; he figures them out on his own.\n",
      "Originally, there was complete silence in the world. However, Chen Ping'an heard a sharp mocking laughter, stopped in his tracks, and indeed saw a peer squatting on the wall, grinning and not hiding his disdainful expression.\n",
      "This person is Chen Ping'an's old neighbor. It is said that he is the illegitimate child of the former supervising official. The official was afraid of criticism and impeachment, so he returned to the capital alone, leaving the child in the care of a successor who had a close relationship with him. Now the town inexplicably loses its qualification to produce official kiln ceramics. The supervising official, who is responsible for overseeing the kiln affairs on behalf of the court, is struggling to protect himself and has no time to care for his colleague's illegitimate child. Leaving some silver behind, he hurriedly went to the capital to mend relationships. Unconsciously, the neighboring teenager has become an abandoned child, but his life is still carefree. He spends his days wandering around with his personal maid, roaming inside and outside the town, enjoying a life of leisure without worrying about money all year round.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mud walls of every household in Niping Lane are very low. In fact, the neighboring teenager doesn't even need to tiptoe to see the scenery inside the courtyard, but every time he talks to Chen Ping'an, he likes to squat on top of the wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared to the superficial and vulgar name Chen Ping'an, the neighboring teenager has a much more elegant name, Song Jixin. Even the maid who relies on him has a formal name, Zhi Gui.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment, the young girl is standing on the other side of the courtyard wall, with timid eyes and a weak appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other side of the courtyard gate, a voice sounded, \"Do you sell this maid?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Song Jixin was stunned and turned his head to look where the voice came from. It was a young man in brocade clothes, with a completely unfamiliar face, smiling and standing outside the courtyard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beside the young man in brocade clothes stood a tall old man with fair complexion and a kind expression. He gently narrowed his eyes and looked at the young men and women in the two adjacent courtyards.\n",
      "The old man's gaze swept past Chen Ping'an without pause, but lingered on Song Jixin and the maid. His smile gradually intensified.\n",
      "\n",
      "Song Jixin squinted and said, \"Sell! Why not sell!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man smiled and said, \"Then name your price.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The young girl widened her eyes, her face full of confusion, like a frightened young deer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Song Jixin rolled his eyes and extended a finger, wiggling it. \"Ten thousand taels of silver!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man in embroidered clothes remained calm and nodded. \"Alright.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing that the young man didn't seem to be joking, Song Jixin quickly changed his offer. \"Ten thousand taels of gold!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A smirk appeared on the young man's lips. \"Just kidding.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Song Jixin's face darkened.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man no longer paid attention to Song Jixin and shifted his gaze towards Chen Ping'an. \"Thanks to you, I was able to buy that carp today. After buying it, the more I looked at it, the happier I became. I thought I must thank you in person, so I asked Grandpa Wu to bring me here overnight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He threw a heavy embroidered bag to Chen Ping'an and smiled brightly. \"This is a token of gratitude. We're even now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Chen Ping'an was about to speak, but the young man in embroidered clothes had already turned and left.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chen Ping'an furrowed his eyebrows.\n",
      "During the day, by chance, Chen Ping'an saw a middle-aged man walking on the street carrying a fish basket. He caught a palm-sized golden carp that was jumping vigorously inside the bamboo basket. Chen Ping'an took a quick glance and felt that it was very auspicious. So he asked if he could buy it for ten coins. The middle-aged man was originally thinking about treating himself to a good meal, but seeing the opportunity for profit, he immediately raised the price and insisted on selling it for thirty coins. However, Chen Ping'an, with limited money in his pocket, couldn't afford that much, and he was reluctant to let go of the golden carp. He followed the middle-aged man, using various methods to persuade him and hoping to bring the price down to fifteen or even twenty coins. Just when the middle-aged man showed signs of weakening, a young man in brocade clothing and an elderly tall man happened to pass by. Without saying a word, they bought the carp and the fish basket for fifty coins. Helplessly, Chen Ping'an could only watch as they walked away with their backs getting farther and farther.\n",
      "Staring fixedly at the receding figures of the old man and the young man, after Song Jixin recovered from his fierce gaze, he jumped off the wall and seemed to remember something. He said to Chen Ping'an, \"Do you remember the four-legged beast in the first month?\"\n",
      "Chen Ping'an nodded.\n",
      "How could he forget? It was still fresh in his memory.\n",
      "According to the customs passed down for hundreds of years in this town, if a snake enters one's house, it is considered a good omen, and the owner should not drive it away or kill it. On the first day of the lunar month, Song Jixin was sitting on the doorstep, sunbathing. Suddenly, a small creature called the \"four-legged snake\" appeared and sneaked into his house right before his eyes. Song Jixin grabbed it and threw it into the yard, thinking that the snake, which had already been thrown around, would be deterred. However, the snake became more determined and kept coming back, which greatly infuriated Song Jixin, who never believed in ghosts and deities. In a fit of anger, he threw it into Chen Pingan's yard. Unexpectedly, the next day, he found the snake curled up under his own bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Song Jixin noticed that the girl tugged at his sleeve. Understanding each other's thoughts, he instinctively stopped the words that were about to come out of his mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "He wanted to say that the hideously ugly four-legged snake had recently developed a protrusion on its forehead, resembling the growth of a horn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Song Jixin changed his words and said, \"Chi Gui and I might leave here next month.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Chen Pingan sighed and said, \"Take care on your journey.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Song Jixin half-jokingly said, \"There are some things that I definitely can't take with me. Don't take advantage of my absence and steal things recklessly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Chen Pingan shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Song Jixin suddenly burst into laughter, pointing at Chen Pingan with his finger and jokingly said, \"You are such a coward. No wonder your poor family has no distinguished offspring. Not to mention being poor and humble in this lifetime, maybe you can't escape it in the next.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Chen Pingan remained silent.\n",
      "They each returned to their rooms. Chen Ping'an closed the door and lay down on the hard wooden bed. The impoverished youth closed his eyes and murmured softly, \"Broken, broken, peace; every year, safe. Broken, broken, peace; every year, safe...\"\n",

      "Chapter 2 - Open the door\n",
      "The sky was just starting to brighten, before the rooster crowed, Chen Ping'an had already woken up. The thin bedding couldn't retain any warmth, and Chen Ping'an had already developed a habit of waking up early and sleeping late when he was an apprentice in the porcelain-making industry. Chen Ping'an opened the door and stepped into the soft soil courtyard. After taking a deep breath, he stretched lazily and walked out of the yard. He turned his head and saw a slender figure, bending over with a wooden bucket of water, using her shoulders to push open the door to her own yard. It was Song Jixin's maidservant, who had just returned from fetching water at the iron lock well in Apricot Blossom Lane. \n",
      "\n",
      "Chen Ping'an diverted his gaze, crossed the streets and alleys, and jogged towards the east side of the town. Mud Bottle Lane was on the west side of the town, and the easternmost city gate was guarded by someone responsible for the entry and exit of the town's merchants and the nightly patrols. They also collected and delivered some letters sent from outside. What Chen Ping'an had to do next was to deliver those letters to the townspeople. The payment was one letter for one copper coin. This was the hard-earned way he had managed to find. Chen Ping'an had already made an agreement with them. After the Dragon Raising its Head on the second day of the second lunar month, he would start taking over this business.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Song Jixin's words, he was destined to be poor and miserable. Even if he had blessings, Chen Ping'an couldn't hold onto them. Song Jixin often said some obscure and difficult-to-understand words, probably borrowed from books. Chen Ping'an couldn't understand them very well. For example, a few days ago, he mentioned something about the freezing cold of early spring killing young people; Chen Ping'an didn't understand at all. As for experiencing that it was even colder for a period of time after winter had passed and spring arrived, he could personally feel it. Song Jixin said it was called \"reversing the cold of spring,\" just as powerful as a spear in the battlefield, so many people would die at these gates of hell.\n",
      "The small town was not surrounded by city walls. After all, there were few bandits and thieves, let alone thieves and ruffians. So, in name, there were city gates, but in reality, they were just a row of old and crooked fences. It was a makeshift passage for pedestrians and vehicles, which could be considered the face of the town.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Chen Pingan hurriedly passed by Xinghua Lane, he saw many women and children gathered by the iron well, and the well wheel kept creaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "After turning around another street, Chen Pingan heard a familiar sound of reading not far away. There was a village school there, which was funded by several wealthy families in the town. The school teacher was an outsider. When Chen Pingan was young, he would often hide outside the window and secretly listen with pricked ears. Although the teacher was very strict during class, he did not scold or stop the children like Chen Pingan who \"snuck in to study and learn\". Later, Chen Pingan went to work as an apprentice in a dragon kiln outside the town and never went to the school again.\n",
      "Moving forward, Chen Ping'an passed by a stone archway. Due to the twelve stone columns supporting the archway, the locals liked to call it the \"Crab Archway\". The true name of this archway was very different according to Song Jixin and Liu Yangxian. Song Jixin firmly believed that in an old book called \"Local County Records\", it was referred to as the \"Grand Scholar Archway,\" a plaque gifted by the emperor himself to commemorate a high-ranking official's accomplishments in governance and military. On the other hand, Liu Yangxian, a typical unrefined individual, insisted it was the \"Crab Archway\". \"We've been calling it that for centuries, there's no reason to call it some nonsense 'Grand Scholar Archway'.\" Liu Yangxian even asked Song Jixin, \"How big is the hat of a grand scholar? Is it bigger than the opening of an iron well?\" This question made Song Jixin blush.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment, Chen Ping'an ran a lap around the twelve-foot archway. Each side of it had four large characters, with unique fonts that were all different from each other. These characters were \"To Not Hesitate in Acting\", \"Seek Words Naturally\", \"Do Not Seek Outside\", and \"Brimming with Courage\". Song Jixin explained that except for these four characters, the inscriptions on the other three places had been smeared and tampered with. Chen Ping'an was ignorant and had never really pondered over these matters. Of course, even if the young man wanted to dig deeper, it would be in vain. He had no idea what book Song Jixin often mentioned, the \"Local County Records,\" actually was.\n",
      "After passing through the archway, not far away, one quickly sees a lush old locust tree. Under the tree, there is a tree trunk that was moved to this place by someone unknown. After being roughly cut, two green stones are placed under both ends of the trunk, turning it into a makeshift bench. Every summer, the people of the small town like to relax here. Wealthy families would even retrieve a basket of chilled fruits and melons from the well. The children, after eating and drinking their fill, would form groups and play under the shade of the tree. Chen Ping'an was used to wandering in the mountains and rivers, so he ran to the entrance gate of the fence and stopped in front of the lonely yellow mud door. His heart was calm and his breathing steady.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not many outsiders visit the town. According to reason, with the official kiln that was once a gold mine gone, there shouldn't be any new faces. When Old Yao was alive, there was one time when he got drunk and said to Chen Ping'an and Liu Xianyang, his apprentices, that what they were doing was a unique business under the heavens. They were producing imperial porcelain for the Emperor and Empress. Even if other commoners were wealthy or held high positions, daring to touch it would result in beheading. Old Yao's spirit was particularly different that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, Chen Ping'an looked outside the fence and found that many people were waiting for the city gate to open. There were at least seven or eight of them, men, women, young, and old.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, these were all strangers. The local people of the small town rarely pass through the East Gate, whether it's to burn porcelain or to work in the fields. The reason is simple - the road beyond the East Gate doesn't lead to any dragon kilns or farmland.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment, Chen Ping'an and those outsiders stood facing each other, separated by a wooden fence.\n",
      "At that moment, the young boy wearing homemade straw shoes couldn't help but envy those people wearing thick clothes. They must be warm and able to withstand the cold. The people outside the gate seemed to be divided into several groups, not belonging to the same faction. However, they all looked at the slender young boy inside the gate. Most of them had indifferent expressions, with the occasional one or two people whose gaze had already passed through the figure of the boy and looked towards the distant town.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chen Ping'an felt a bit strange. Did these people not know that the imperial court had already banned all dragon kilns? Or did they know the truth and thought they could take advantage of the situation? \n",
      "\n",
      "There was a young man with a strange tall crown on his head. He had a slender figure and a green jade pendant hanging from his waist. He seemed impatient and walked out of the crowd alone, wanting to push open the unlocked gate. However, just as his fingers were about to touch the wooden door, he suddenly stopped abruptly, slowly withdrew his hand, crossed his hands behind his back, and smiled as he looked at the young boy in straw shoes inside the gate without saying a word, just smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Out of the corner of Chen Ping'an's eye, he inadvertently noticed the people behind the young man. Some seemed disappointed, some were playful, some frowned, and some sneered. Their emotions were subtle and varied.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment, a middle-aged man with messy hair suddenly opened the door and cursed at Chen Ping'an, \"You little bastard, did you lose your damn mind? Coming to pester me so early in the morning for the soul-calling, are you in such a hurry to be reincarnated and meet your dead parents, huh?!\"\n",
      "Chen Ping'an rolled his eyes in response to the sarcastic remarks. The young man did not care about these words. First of all, he lived in a remote rural area with very few books. If he got annoyed by being scolded a few times, it would be better for him to jump into a well and save himself the trouble. Secondly, this middle-aged bachelor who was guarding the gate was already a subject of ridicule and jokes from the townspeople, especially those bold and daring women who not only cursed at him but also physically assaulted him. Moreover, this person loved to brag to kids wearing crotchless pants, such as boasting about how he had once had a great fight at the city gate, beating up five or six big men, their teeth scattered all over the ground, blood everywhere. The road in front of the city gate, which was two zhang wide, was nothing different from a muddy road on a rainy day!\n",
      "\n",
      "Chen Ping'an said irritably, \"Your trashy matters can wait till later.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "No one in the town took this guy seriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, when it came to outsiders entering the town, the man held the power of life and death.\n",
      "\n",
      "While walking towards the wooden fence gate, he reached into his crotch.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man, with his back to Chen Ping'an, occasionally collected small embroidered bags from people, putting them in his sleeve, and then allowed them to pass one by one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chen Ping'an had long given way on the road. Eight people were roughly divided into five groups, walking towards the town. Besides the young man wearing a tall crown and a green pendant around his waist, two children aged seven or eight had also passed by, a boy wearing a festive red robe and a girl with a delicate appearance, akin to fine porcelain.\n",
      "The boy was almost half a head shorter than Chen Ping'an. When the child brushed past him, he opened his mouth and though no sound came out, there was an obvious lip movement which seemed to be two provocative words. The middle-aged woman holding the boy gently coughed, and the child then slightly restrained himself. The little girl behind the woman, who was being led by a robust old man with a head full of white hair, turned her head and said a long string of words to Chen Ping'an, all the while pointing and gesturing at the boy in front of her. Chen Ping'an couldn't understand what the girl was saying, but he could guess that she was complaining about something. The robust old man cast a sidelong glance at the boy wearing straw shoes, who had simply glanced at him unintentionally. Chen Ping'an instinctively took a step back, like a mouse encountering a cat. Seeing this scene, the little girl, who had previously been chirping like a little yellow bird, suddenly lost interest and turned her head away, as if looking at Chen Ping'an any longer would dirty her eyes. Although the young Chen Ping'an was inexperienced, it did not mean that he couldn't read people's expressions. After the group of people had gone far away, the gatekeeper smiled and asked, \"Do you want to know what they said?\" Chen Ping'an nodded and said, \"Yes.\" The middle-aged bachelor laughed and said, \"They were praising how handsome you are, all good words.\" Chen Ping'an twitched his mouth, thinking to himself, \"Do you take me for a fool?\" Seeing through the young boy's thoughts, the gatekeeper laughed even more happily and said, \"If you're not a fool, would you like me to let you deliver a message?\" Chen Ping'an didn't dare to argue, afraid of offending this guy and losing the money that was about to come into his hands.\n",
      "The man turned his head and looked at those people, rubbing his stubbly chin with his hand. He muttered in a low voice, \"That woman earlier could crush someone between her legs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Chen Ping'an hesitated for a moment and curiously asked, \"Has that lady practiced martial arts?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The man was stunned, looked down at the young boy, and said seriously, \"You, kid, are truly foolish.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The young boy was completely confused.\n",
      "\n",
      "He told Chen Ping'an to wait and walked towards the house in big strides. When he came back, he had a stack of envelopes in his hand, not too thick or thin, about ten of them. After handing them to Chen Ping'an, the man asked, \"Good things come to those who wait foolishly, and kind people receive good rewards. Do you believe it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Chen Ping'an held the letters in one hand and spread his palm with the other, blinking his eyes. \"Didn't we agree on one letter for one cent?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The man became angry and embarrassed, slapped five copper coins that he had prepared beforehand on the young boy's palm, and waved his big hand, saying boldly, \"You owe me five cents for now!\"\n",

      "The town is neither big nor small, with over six hundred households. Chen Pingan is familiar with the doors of the poor families in the town, but as for the wealthy families with solid backgrounds, they are difficult to approach for a commoner like him. Chen Pingan has never even set foot in the wide alleys where the wealthy families gather. The streets there are mostly paved with large pieces of bluestone, so even on rainy days, there is no mud splattered when you step on it. After being trampled by people and carriages for thousands of years, these bluestones have become as smooth as mirrors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The surnames Lu, Li, Zhao, and Song are considered prominent families in this town. The money for the village school comes from these few families, and they each own two or three large dragon kilns outside the city. The official residence of the supervisor in charge of the kilns is located on the same street as these households.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, almost all of the ten letters that Chen Pingan has to deliver today are to the well-to-do families that this small town is known for. This is reasonable, as the saying goes, \"A dragon begets a dragon, a phoenix begets a phoenix, and a mouse's offspring can dig a hole.\" Those who are able to send letters back home while traveling far away must come from well-off families, otherwise they wouldn't have the confidence to embark on a journey. Among the nine letters, Chen Pingan actually only goes to two places: Fulu Street and Taoye Alley. When he stepped on the bluestone slabs as big as beds for the first time, the young man felt a little uneasy and slowed down his pace. He couldn't help but feel ashamed, thinking that his straw sandals would dirty the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first letter Chen Pingan delivered was to the Lu family, who had received an emperor's jade scepter as a gift from their ancestors. When the young man stood at the door, he became even more restless.\n",
      "In wealthy households, there are many luxuries to be found. The Lu family's mansion is not only large, but it also has two stone lions placed at the entrance. These lions are tall and imposing. Song Jixin said that these ornaments can ward off evil spirits, but Chen Ping'an has no idea what that means. He is simply curious about the round stone balls held in the mouths of the tall lions. How were they carved out? Chen Ping'an restrains his impulse to touch the stone balls and walks up the steps. He knocks on the bronze lion door knocker, and soon a young man opens the door. When he hears that Chen Ping'an is delivering a letter, the young man shows no expression. He uses his two fingers to pinch the corner of the envelope, takes the letter, and quickly walks into the mansion, closing the door heavily behind him with the painted door-god statue on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Afterward, the process of delivering the letters is unremarkable. At the corner of Tao Ye Alley, there is a household with an obscure reputation. The person who opens the door is a kind-eyed and benevolent elderly man. After accepting the letter, he smiles and says, \"Young man, you've worked hard. Would you like to come in and rest, have a hot drink?\" The young man smiles shyly, shakes his head, and runs away.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man gently puts the family letter into his sleeve and doesn't rush back to his residence. He looks up into the distance, his gaze unfocused. Finally, his gaze descends from high to low, from far to near, and focuses on the peach trees on both sides of the street. The seemingly senile and muddled old man finally squeezes out a smile. He turns around and leaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not long after, a cute little yellow sparrow lands on a branch of a peach tree. Its beak pecks gently, still tender, and it chirps softly.\n",
      "The last letter to be sent, Chen Ping'an needs to deliver it to the teacher who teaches at the village school. Along the way, he passes by a fortune-telling booth where a young Taoist priest in an old Daoist robe is sitting behind a table with a straight posture. He wears a tall hat, resembling a blooming lotus flower.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the young Taoist sees the approaching youth, he quickly greets, \"Young man, don't miss out as you pass by. Come and draw a divination stick. This humble Taoist can help you predict good and bad luck.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Chen Ping'an doesn't stop his footsteps but turns his head and waves his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Taoist persists and leans forward, raising his voice, \"Young man, in the past, I charged ten copper coins for interpreting divination sticks for others. But today, I'll make an exception and only charge you three copper coins! Of course, if you draw an auspicious stick, you may want to give an extra one copper coin as a joyous offering. And if luck is great and you draw an extremely auspicious stick, this humble Taoist will only charge you five copper coins. How about it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "From a distance, Chen Ping'an's steps noticeably pause. The young Taoist quickly stands up, striking while the iron is hot, and says loudly, \"Early in the morning, you are the first customer, so this humble Taoist will provide good services. As long as you sit down to draw a stick, I won't hide it from you. I will write some talismans on yellow paper to pray for blessings from your ancestors and accumulate good karma. With my abilities, I can't guarantee that it will bring great wealth and high status, but if it can bring 1-2 blessings, it's worth a try.\" Chen Ping'an hesitates and then turns back, sitting on the bench in front of the booth.\n",
      "\n",
      "A simple Taoist priest and a poor young man, sitting opposite each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Taoist smiles and extends his hand, signaling for the young man to pick up the divination tube.\n",
      "Chen Ping'an hesitated and suddenly said, \"I won't draw lots, can you just write a yellow paper talisman for me, is that okay?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In Chen Ping'an's memory, it seemed that this young Daoist had been staying in the small town for at least five or six years. His appearance hadn't changed much, and he was always friendly to everyone. He usually helped people with bone fortune-telling, face reading, divination, and occasionally wrote letters on behalf of others. Interestingly, on the desk, there was a bamboo container with one hundred and eight fortune-telling sticks. Over the years, no one in the town had drawn the highest fortune, nor had anyone drawn the lowest fortune. It was as if all one hundred and eight sticks were filled with good fortune.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, on festive occasions, if people spent ten copper coins just to get some good luck, the townsfolk could accept it. However, when it came to troublesome matters, no one would be willing to be a fool here. If this Daoist were a complete fraud, it would be unfair to accuse him. The town was small, if he was only good at trickery and deception, he would have been driven away long ago. Therefore, it was certain that this young Daoist's abilities were not limited to fortune-telling and writing talismans. However, he was quite effective in curing minor ailments. Many people who drank a bowl of his talisman water would quickly recover.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young Daoist shook his head and said, \"I, as a humble Daoist, always act with honesty. We agreed on both fortune-telling and writing talismans, and it will cost you five copper coins.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Chen Ping'an softly retorted, \"It should be three copper coins.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Daoist laughed and said, \"But what if you draw the highest fortune? Then it will be five copper coins.\"\n",
      "Chen Ping'an made up his mind and reached out to grab the lottery tube. Suddenly, he looked up and asked, \"How did you know that I happened to have five wen coins on me?\"\n",
      "The Taoist sat solemnly and replied, \"This humble Taoist can accurately assess a person's fortune and wealth. I have always been accurate.\"\n",
      "After thinking for a moment, Chen Ping'an picked up the lottery tube.\n",
      "The Taoist smiled and said, \"Young man, don't be nervous. There is a time for everything in one's destiny. If it's not your time yet, don't force it. Treat unforeseen events with equanimity. That is the best way.\"\n",
      "Chen Ping'an put the lottery tube back on the table, with a serious expression, and asked, \"Taoist, I will give you all five wen coins without drawing the lottery. Can you please write the yellow paper talisman with better runes than usual?\"\n",
      "The Taoist smiled as usual, pondered for a moment, and nodded, \"Sure.\"\n",
      "On the table, ink, brush, inkstone, and paper were already prepared. The Taoist carefully asked for the names, birthplaces, and birthdays of Chen Ping'an's parents, and quickly finished writing on a yellow piece of paper in one breath.\n",
      "As for what was written, Chen Ping'an had no idea.\n",
      "After putting down the brush and picking up the talisman, the young Taoist blew on the ink, saying, \"When you bring it home, stand at the threshold and burn the yellow paper outside the door.\"\n",
      "The young man solemnly accepted the talisman, treasured it carefully, and did not forget to leave the five copper coins on the table before bowing and expressing his gratitude.\n",
      "The young Taoist waved his hand, indicating the young man to go about his own business.\n",
      "Chen Ping'an ran off to deliver his last letter.\n",
      "The Taoist lazily leaned back in his chair, glanced at the copper coins, and bent down to pick them up in his hand.\n",
      "Just at this moment, a small and delicate yellow sparrow flew down from the sky and lightly pecked at a copper coin on the table. Quickly losing interest, it spread its wings and flew away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The yellow sparrow desires to carry flowers in its beak, but your family's peach blossoms have not yet bloomed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After reciting this poem with ease, the Daoist sighed, pretending to be laid-back as he lightly waved his sleeve, saying, \"In life, one can only strive for what is within reach and not seek what is unattainable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With a wave of his sleeve, two bamboo sticks slipped out from his sleeve and fell to the ground. The Daoist exclaimed and hastily picked them up. He then looked around cautiously and, seeing that no one was paying attention, he felt relieved and hid the two bamboo sticks in the loose cuff of his sleeve. The young Daoist cleared his throat, put on a serious face, and continued to stand by the tree, waiting for the next visitor.\n",
      "\n",
      "He couldn't help but feel a bit emotional; it was indeed easier to earn money from women.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, the two bamboo sticks hidden in the young Daoist's sleeve were the top and bottom fortune sticks, both used to make big money.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not to be told to outsiders.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man naturally didn't understand these mysterious secrets. As he walked lightly, he arrived outside a village school. The nearby bamboo forest was lush and brimming with greenery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chen Ping'an slowed down his pace, and from inside the house came the deep voice of a middle-aged man, \"The sun rising casts brilliant rays, and the lamb fur glistens with dew.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, a clear and crisp childish voice chimed in, \"The sun rising casts brilliant rays, and the lamb fur glistens with dew.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Chen Ping'an looked up, the rising sun shining grandly and magnificently.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man was momentarily stunned.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he came to his senses, he saw the school children shaking their heads and reciting a passage as instructed by their teacher: \"In the time of Jingzhe, the heavens and the earth awaken, and all things begin to flourish. Sleeping at night and rising early, take wide strides in the courtyard. A gentleman walks slowly to facilitate clarity of mind...\"\n",
      "Chen Pingan stood at the entrance of the academy, hesitant to speak.\n",
      "A middle-aged Confucian scholar with a hint of gray in his temples turned his head and walked out of the house gently.\n",
      "Chen Pingan handed over the letter with both hands, respectfully saying, \"This is Master's letter.\"\n",
      "The tall man in a green robe took the envelope and kindly said, \"You can come here to listen often when you have nothing else to do.\"\n",
      "Chen Pingan felt a bit embarrassed, as he might not truly have the time to come and listen to this master teach. The young man didn't want to deceive him.\n",
      "The man smiled, understanding his predicament, and said, \"It's alright. The principles are all in the books, but being a good person goes beyond that. You can go on with your tasks.\"\n",
      "Chen Pingan breathed a sigh of relief and bid farewell before leaving.\n",
      "After running far away, the young man turned back unconsciously.\n",
      "He saw that the master was still standing at the entrance, his figure bathed in sunlight, from afar, as if he were a deity.\n",
