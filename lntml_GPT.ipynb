      "\n",
      "In the twilight, in a quiet corner of a town called Niping Lane, there was a lonely and skinny young man. According to tradition, he held a candle in one hand and a peach branch in the other, illuminating the beams, walls, and wooden bed, using the peach branch to knock and drive away snakes, scorpions, centipedes, and so on. He murmured the old saying that had been passed down through generations in this town: \"On the second day of the second month, candles illuminate the beams, peaches hit the walls, and there is nowhere for snakes and worms to hide in the human world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man's surname was Chen, and his given name was Ping'an. His parents had passed away early. The town was famous for its porcelain, and since the founding of this dynasty, it had taken on the important task of \"being appointed to supervise the burning and offer sacrificial vessels at the mausoleum\". Officials from the court were stationed here all year round to oversee the affairs of the official kiln. The young man, who had no one to rely on, had started working as a potter in the kiln at a young age. At first, he could only do odd jobs and rough work, following a master with a bad temper. After struggling for a few years, he had just begun to grasp the techniques of porcelain-making. But suddenly, things changed. The town lost its status as the official kiln, and dozens of dragon kilns surrounding the town were ordered to close overnight by the government.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chen Ping'an put down the newly cut peach branch, extinguished the candle, and walked out of the house. He sat on the steps and looked up at the starry sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man still vividly remembered his old master, Yao, who only acknowledged him as a half-apprentice. Last year, in the late autumn morning, Yao was found sitting in a small bamboo chair, facing the direction of the kiln, with his eyes closed. However, such narrow-minded people like Old Yao were in the minority.\n",
      "\n",
      "The craftsmen in this town, who had been involved in porcelain-making for generations, did not dare to surpass the official kiln for making tribute porcelain, nor did they dare to sell the stored porcelain to the people without permission. They had to seek alternative ways to make a living. Chen Ping'an, who was fourteen years old, was also kicked out and returned to Niping Lane, continuing to guard this dilapidated old house that was almost empty. Even if Chen Ping'an wanted to squander his fortune, he had no idea where to start.\n",
      "\n",
      "After being a vagrant for a while, Chen Ping'an couldn't find a way to earn money. With his meager savings, he barely managed to fill his stomach. A few days ago, he heard that an outsider blacksmith named Ruan had come to Qilong Lane a few blocks away, claiming to take in seven or eight apprentices for blacksmithing without paying wages, but providing meals. Chen Ping'an hurriedly went there to try his luck. Unexpectedly, the old man just glanced at him and rejected him. At that time, Chen Ping'an wondered, was blacksmithing not based on physical strength but on appearance?\n",
      "\n",
      "It should be noted that although Chen Ping'an looked frail, his strength should not be underestimated. It was the foundation of his body that he had developed through years of pottery-making. In addition, Chen Ping'an had followed the old man Yao, traveling through the mountains and waters within a hundred miles of the town, and tasted the flavors of various soils in the surrounding area. He was willing to do any dirty and tiring work without complaining. Unfortunately, Old Yao never liked Chen Ping'an and despised the young man for lacking insight, thinking he was like a block of wood that couldn't be carved. He was far inferior to his big apprentice Liu Xianyang. It was not surprising that the old man was biased. The master leads the door, and the practice is up to the individual. For example, the same tedious pottery-making task, Liu Xianyang's skill in just half a year was equivalent to Chen Ping'an's three years of hard work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although Chen Ping'an might not need this skill in his lifetime, he still closed his eyes and imagined that there were green slabs and potter's wheels in front of him, and started practicing pottery-making. Practice makes perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "After about fifteen minutes, the young man would take a short break, shake his wrist, and repeat this cycle until he was completely exhausted. Then, Chen Ping'an would get up, stroll in the courtyard, and slowly stretch his muscles and bones. Nobody had taught Chen Ping'an all these things; he had figured them out on his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the silence of the world, Chen Ping'an heard a harsh mocking laughter. He stopped in his tracks and, sure enough, saw a peer squatting on the wall, grinning without hiding his disdainful expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "This person was Chen Ping'an's old neighbor, rumored to be the illegitimate child of the former supervisor. The supervisor, fearing criticism from the literati and imperial censors, had returned to the capital alone after performing his duties and entrusted the child to a successor who had a close relationship with him to take care of. Now that the town had inexplicably lost the qualification to produce official kiln porcelain, the supervisor in charge of overseeing the kiln affairs for the court was too preoccupied with his own survival to care about the supervisor's illegitimate child and left some silver coins before hastily heading to the capital to manage his relationships. Unknowingly, the neighbor's young man, who had already become a castaway, was living a carefree life, wandering inside and outside the town all year round with his personal maidservant, idling his time away without ever worrying about money.\n",
      "\n",
      "The earthen walls of every household in Niping Lane were low, and the neighbor's young man could easily see the scene in Chen Ping'an's yard without even having to tiptoe. But every time he talked to Chen Ping'an, he liked to squat on the wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared to the superficial and vulgar name \"Chen Ping'an,\" the neighbor's young man had a much more elegant name, Song Jixin. Even the maid who depended on him had a refined name, Zhigui. The girl was standing on the other side of the courtyard wall at this moment, with a pair of apricot eyes, timid and weak.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other side of the courtyard gate, a voice rang out, \"Do you sell this maid?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Song Jixin paused for a moment, turned his head towards the voice, and saw a well-dressed young man with a completely unfamiliar face standing outside the courtyard, smiling with his eyes.\n",

      "Standing next to the young man in brocade was a tall old man with fair complexion and a kind expression, gently squinting his eyes as he observed the young boys and girls in the adjacent courtyards. The old man's gaze quickly swept past Chen Ping'an without hesitation, but lingered on Song Jixin and the maidservant, his smile gradually deepening. \n",
      "\n",
      "Song Jixin raised an eyebrow and said, \"Sell! Why not sell?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "The young man smiled and replied, \"Then tell me the price.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "The young girl widened her eyes, her face full of confusion, like a startled young deer. \n",
      "\n",
      "Song Jixin rolled his eyes and held up a finger, shaking it. \"Ten thousand taels of silver!\" \n",
      "\n",
      "The young man remained calm and nodded. \"Deal.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Song Jixin, seeing that the young man was not joking, quickly changed his offer. \"It's ten thousand taels of gold!\" \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Song Jixin's face darkened. \n",
      "\n",
      "The young man ignored Song Jixin and shifted his gaze to Chen Ping'an. \"Thanks to you today, I was able to buy that carp. After buying it, the more I looked at it, the more delighted I became. I wanted to thank you in person, so I had Mr. Wu bring me here overnight.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "He tossed a heavy embroidered bag to Chen Ping'an with a smile. \"This is my gratitude. We're even now.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Chen Ping'an was about to say something, but the young man had already turned and left. \n",
      "\n",
      "Chen Ping'an furrowed his brow. \n",
      "\n",
      "During the day, he accidentally saw a middle-aged man carrying a fish basket walking on the street and caught a gold carp about the length of a palm. It was jumping around energetically in the bamboo basket, and Chen Ping'an felt a sense of jubilation at a glance. So he asked if he could buy it for ten wen. The middle-aged man, thinking of rewarding his own organs, saw a profit and raised the price, asking for thirty wen before he would sell. Chen Ping'an didn't have that much spare money in his pouch, and he couldn't bear to part with the golden carp, so he followed the middle-aged man, trying to bargain the price down to fifteen or even twenty wen. When the middle-aged man showed signs of relenting, the young man in brocade and the tall old man happened to pass by. Without saying a word, they bought the carp and basket for fifty wen, leaving Chen Ping'an to watch helplessly as they walked away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Staring fixedly at the receding figures of the elder and grandson, Song Jixin recalled something and said to Chen Ping'an, \"Do you still remember the four-legged snake from the first month?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Chen Ping'an nodded. \n",
      "\n",
      "How could he forget? It was still fresh in his memory. \n",
      "\n",
      "According to the centuries-old customs of this small town, if a snake enters one's house, it is a good omen, and the owner should never drive it away or kill it. Song Jixin was sitting on the doorstep sunbathing on the first day of the lunar month, and then a small creature that people called a four-legged snake darted into his house right in front of his eyes. Song Jixin grabbed it and threw it into the yard, thinking that the badly battered snake would be discouraged. But to his surprise, the four-legged snake, with its resilience growing from each setback, repeatedly confronted Song Jixin, who had never believed in ghosts or spirits. Infuriated, Song Jixin threw the snake into Chen Ping'an's yard. Little did he know that the next day, he found the snake curled up under his own bed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Song Jixin felt the girl tugging at his sleeve. \n",
      "\n",
      "The young man and she had a deep connection, so he instinctively swallowed the words that were about to come out of his mouth. \n",
      "\n",
      "What he wanted to say was that the extremely ugly four-legged snake had developed a lump on its forehead recently, resembling a horn. \n",
      "\n",
      "Song Jixin changed his words and said, \"Chizhi and I may be leaving here next month.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Chen Ping'an sighed. \"Take care on the journey.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Half serious and half joking, Song Jixin said, \"There are some things that I definitely can't take with me. Don't take advantage of my absence to steal things.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Chen Ping'an shook his head. \n",
      "\n",
      "Song Jixin suddenly burst into laughter, pointing at Chen Ping'an with his finger playfully. \"As timid as a mouse, no wonder the poor can be bullied in this life. Maybe you won't be able to escape it in the next life either.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Chen Ping'an remained silent. \n",
      "\n",
      "They each returned to their rooms. Chen Ping'an closed the door and lay on the hard wooden bed. The poor youth closed his eyes and murmured softly, \"Pieces of peace, safety every year, pieces of peace, safety every year...\"\n",

The thin blanket couldn't retain any heat, and Chen Pingan had developed the habit of getting up early and staying up late when he was an apprentice in the porcelain-making business. Chen Pingan opened the door and stepped into the soft earth courtyard. After taking a deep breath and stretching, he walked out of the yard and turned to see a delicate figure bent over, carrying a wooden bucket of water on her shoulders and pushing open the gate of her own courtyard.

      "Chen Pingan averted his gaze, quickly crossed the streets, and ran towards the east side of the town. Mud Bottle Alley was on the west side of the town, and the easternmost gate of the town was responsible for the entry and exit of merchants and the patrol during the curfew. They also collected and delivered letters sent from the outside. The next thing Chen Pingan had to do was to deliver those letters to the people of the town. The reward was one letter for one copper coin, and this was the hard-earned way for him to make money. Chen Pingan had already made arrangements with them to take over this business after the second day of the second month of the lunar calendar.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Song Jixin's words, it was his fate to be poor and destitute. Even if he had the good fortune to enter someone's household, Chen Pingan couldn't hold onto it or leave a lasting impression. Song Jixin often said some obscure and incomprehensible words, perhaps taken from books. Chen Pingan never quite understood them. For example, a few days ago, he was muttering something about \"the freezing cold of early spring freezing young people to death.\" Chen Pingan didn't understand at all. As for the fact that after surviving the winter, it actually became colder in the first few days of spring, the young people could fully comprehend it. Song Jixin said it was called the \"reverse spring chill,\" just as powerful as a cavalry's spear on the battlefield. Many people would die in these ghostly passes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The town was not surrounded by city walls, as there were hardly any bandits or thieves, let alone robbers. So, although it was called a city gate, it was actually a row of crooked and dilapidated fences, where people and vehicles could pass through, serving as the face of the town.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Chen Pingan ran past Apricot Blossom Lane, he saw many women and children gathered by the Iron Lock Well, and the pulley of the well kept creaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "After turning another street, Chen Pingan soon heard a familiar voice reading not far away. There was a village school there that several wealthy families in the town had pooled their money together to establish. The schoolmaster was an outsider. When Chen Pingan was young, he often ran there and hid outside the window, secretly listening. Although the schoolmaster was strict when teaching, he didn't scold or obstruct Chen Pingan and the other children who sneaked in to study and learn. After Chen Pingan went to work as an apprentice in a kiln outside the town, he never went back to the school.\n",
      "\n",
      "Continuing on, Chen Pingan passed a stone archway. The archway had twelve stone pillars, so the locals liked to call it the Crab Archway. The real name of the archway, according to Song Jixin and Liu Yangxian, was quite different. Song Jixin firmly believed that in an old book called \"Local County Annals\", it was referred to as the Grand Scholar Archway, a plaque bestowed by the emperor himself, commemorating the achievements of a high-ranking official in both literature and military. Liu Yangxian, who was just an average person like Chen Pingan, said it was called the Crab Archway and had been called that for hundreds of years. There was no reason to call it the nonsense Grand Scholar Archway. Liu Yangxian even asked Song Jixin, \"Just how big is the official hat of a Grand Scholar? Is it even bigger than the mouth of the Iron Lock Well?\" This made Song Jixin blush with embarrassment.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment, Chen Pingan jogged around the Crab Archway. Each side of the archway had four large words written on it, with peculiar fonts and different styles. They were \"When virtue calls, do not hesitate,\" \"Let words flow naturally,\" \"Do not seek outside,\" and \"Fierce as a charging bull.\" According to Song Jixin, except for those four words, the other three plaques on the stone carvings had been tampered with and altered. Chen Pingan didn't fully understand these things, but he had never thought deeply about them in his ignorance. Even if he wanted to dig to the bottom of it as a young person, it would be in vain. He didn't even know what the Local County Annals that Song Jixin often mentioned was.\n",
      "\n",
      "After passing the archway, Chen Pingan soon saw a lush old locust tree. At the base of the tree, there was a tree trunk that had been moved there by someone and slightly chopped. Two pieces of bluestone were placed on the ends of the trunk, creating a makeshift bench. During the summer, the townspeople liked to sit here to cool off. Wealthier families would even fetch a basket of chilled fruits and melons from the well, and the children would play and frolic in the shade of the tree after eating and drinking their fill. Chen Pingan, accustomed to going up the mountains and down to the water, ran to the nearby gate of the fence and stopped in front of the lonely yellow mud house. His heart didn't race, and he wasn't out of breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "There weren't many outsiders coming and going from the town, and now that the Emperor's Kiln, a money-making tree, had collapsed, there were even fewer new faces. When Old Yao was still alive, he once got drunk and said to Chen Pingan and Liu Yangxian, his apprentices, that they were in a unique business. They were making imperial porcelain for His Majesty the Emperor and the Empress, and even if other commoners were rich or held high positions, if they dared to touch it, they would be beheaded. Old Yao that day had a particularly different aura.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, as Chen Pingan looked out beyond the fence, he noticed several people waiting for the city gate to open. There were at least seven or eight of them, men, women, old, and young.\n",
      "\n",
      "And they were all strangers. The local townspeople rarely used the East Gate for their comings and goings, be it for making porcelain or farming, for a simple reason: the road that extended from the East Gate had no kilns or fields.\n",

      "At this moment, Chen Ping'an and the outsiders were facing each other across a wooden fence, two by two.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment, the young man wearing self-made straw shoes was just a little envious of the thick clothes worn by those people. They must be warm and able to withstand the cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "The people outside the gate were obviously divided into several groups, not all of them belonging together. But they all looked at the thin young man inside the gate. Most of them had indifferent expressions, but occasionally one or two people would look beyond the young man's figure, gazing at the distant town.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chen Ping'an felt a little strange. Did these people not know that the imperial court had already banned all Dragon Kilns? Or was it because they knew the truth that they thought there was an opportunity to exploit?\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a young man with a peculiar tall hat and a slender figure. He wore a green jade pendant around his waist. He seemed impatient and walked out of the crowd alone. He wanted to push open the unlocked gate of the fence. However, just as his fingers were about to touch the wooden door, he suddenly stopped and slowly retracted his hand, clasping them behind his back. He smiled at the straw-shoed young man inside the gate without saying a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Out of the corner of Chen Ping'an's eye, he inadvertently noticed that the people behind the young man seemed disappointed, amused, frowning, mocking, or had various subtle emotions. Each person was different.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then, a middle-aged man with messy hair suddenly opened the door and scolded Chen Ping'an, \"You little bastard, did you grow money in your eyes? You're here so early to hurry up and call your ghost father and mother?!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Chen Ping'an rolled his eyes. He didn't really care about these sarcastic remarks. Firstly, living in this rural place with scarce books, he wouldn't get annoyed by a few insults. He might as well jump into a well to save himself from trouble. Secondly, this middle-aged bachelor who guarded the gate was already a frequent object of mockery and teasing by the people in the town, especially the bold and fearless women. Not only would they insult him verbally, but there were also quite a few who would physically beat him. Moreover, this man loved boasting to children who wore open-crotch pants. For example, he would say things like \"Back in my day, at the city gate, there was a fierce battle. I fought and beat up five or six big men, causing their teeth to scatter all over the ground. The road in front of the city gate, which is two zhang wide, was nearly as muddy as on a rainy day!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He irritably said to Chen Ping'an, \"We'll talk about your useless matters later.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "No one in the town paid attention to this guy.\n",
      "\n",
      "But whether the outsiders could enter the town or not was controlled by the men, granting them the power of life and death.\n",
      "\n",
      "He walked towards the gate of the wooden fence while reaching into his pants.\n",
      "\n",
      "This man, with his back to Chen Ping'an, occasionally collected small embroidered bags from people after opening the door, putting them in his sleeve, and then letting them through one by one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chen Ping'an had long cleared the way. The eight people could roughly be divided into five groups, heading towards the town. Besides the young man with the tall hat and the green pendant around his waist, two seven or eight-year-old children had also passed by, a boy wearing a festive red robe and a girl looking delicate like fine porcelain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The boy was about half a head shorter than Chen Ping'an. When the child passed by him, he opened his mouth. Although no sound came out, there was an obvious movement of his lips. He should have said two words, full of provocation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The middle-aged woman who was holding the boy lightly coughed, and the child slightly restrained himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The little girl behind the woman and the snow-haired old man holding her turned to Chen Ping'an and said a long string of words, not forgetting to point and gesture at the boy in front of her, who was of the same age.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chen Ping'an couldn't understand what the girl was saying, but he could guess that she was complaining and tattling.\n",
      "\n",
      "The burly old man cast a sidelong glance at the straw-shoed young man, who had just been glanced at intentionally or unintentionally by someone, causing Chen Ping'an to instinctively take a step back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like a mouse seeing a cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing this scene, the once chattering little girl, like a yellow bird, immediately lost interest in stirring up trouble. She turned her head and no longer glanced at Chen Ping'an as if he would dirty her eyes if she looked at him for too long.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though young, Chen Ping'an had never been naive. But not waiting for him to think about it, the gatekeeper chuckled and asked, \"Do you want to know what they said?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Chen Ping'an nodded, \"Yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The middle-aged man laughed and said, \"They were praising you for being good-looking, all good words.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Chen Ping'an tugged at the corner of his mouth, thinking to himself, \"Do you take me for a fool?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing through the young man's thoughts, the man laughed even more joyfully, \"If you're not a fool, can I let you deliver a message?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Chen Ping'an didn't dare to retort, afraid that he would annoy this guy and the copper coins within his reach would fly away.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man turned his head and gazed at those people, rubbing his chin covered in stubble. He whispered, \"That woman just now, her legs could crush a person.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Chen Ping'an hesitated for a moment and curiously asked, \"Did that lady practice martial arts?\"\n",

      "The man was shocked, looked down at the young man, and said seriously, \"You kid, you're really foolish.\"\n",

      "The young man was puzzled.\n",
      "\n",
      "He told Chen Ping'an to wait, and briskly walked towards the house. When he came back, he had a stack of envelopes in his hand, not thick or thin, about ten in total.

      "The town was neither big nor small, with over six hundred households. Chen Ping'an recognized most of the poor families in the town, but the wealthy families with solid backgrounds were a different story. The threshold was high, and a commoner like Chen Ping'an couldn't step into those spacious alleyways where the rich families gathered. The streets there were paved with large green stone slabs, so even on rainy days, one wouldn't step into mud and splash it around. These excellent quality green stone slabs had been smoothed as mirrors over the centuries by the trampling of people and carriages.\n",
      "\n",
      "The surnames Lu, Li, Zhao, and Song were prominent in the town. The money for the village school came from these families, and they each owned two to three large dragon kilns outside the city. The official residences of the kiln supervisors throughout the years were on the same street as these households.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, almost all of the ten letters Chen Ping'an had to deliver today were going to the well-off families known in the town. This was reasonable since \"a dragon gives birth to a dragon, a phoenix gives birth to a phoenix, and a rat's child knows how to burrow.\" A traveler who could send letters back home from afar must come from a well-off family, or else they wouldn't have the confidence to travel. Out of these nine letters, Chen Ping'an was actually headed to only two places: Fulu Street and Taoye Lane. When he first stepped onto the green stone slabs as large as beds, the youth felt somewhat anxious. He slowed down his steps, feeling somewhat embarrassed and even thought his straw shoes had dirtied the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first letter Chen Ping'an delivered was to the Lu family, who had received an imperial jade scepter as a gift from the emperor in ancestral times. Standing at the door, the youth became even more uneasy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rich families appreciated grandeur, and the Lu family not only had a large mansion but also two stone lions placed at their doorstep. The lions were tall and imposing. Song Jixin said that these things could ward off evil spirits. Chen Ping'an had no idea what evil spirits were, but he was curious about the sphere held in the mouth of the taller lion. How was it carved? Chen Ping'an resisted the urge to touch the stone sphere and walked up the steps to knock on the bronze lion's head knocker. Soon, a young man opened the door and, upon hearing that Chen Ping'an was delivering a letter, took it without expression. He pinched a corner of the envelope with his fingers and then quickly walked into the mansion, shutting the door heavily, which was adorned with a painted statue of the God of Wealth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The subsequent letter deliveries were equally uneventful. At the corner of Taoye Lane, a little-known family opened the door. An elderly person with a kind face accepted the letter and smiled, saying, \"Young man, you've worked hard. Would you like to come in and rest, have some hot water?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The youth smiled shyly, shook his head, and ran away.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old person gently put the letter in their sleeve and didn't rush back to their residence. They looked into the distance with a hazy gaze.\n",
      "\n",
      "From high to low, from afar to near, their gaze focused on the peach trees on both sides of the street. Seemingly senile and dull, the old person finally squeezed out a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old person turned and left.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not long after, a cute yellow finch landed on a peach tree branch. Its beak pecked softly, and it chirped lightly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last letter that remained was to be delivered to the teacher who taught at the village school. Along the way, Chen Ping'an passed by a fortune-telling stall. There sat a young Taoist priest in an old Daoist robe, sitting upright with a high hat on his head like a blooming lotus.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the young Taoist saw Chen Ping'an running past, he quickly greeted him, \"Young man, don't pass by without stopping. Come draw a divination stick. This humble Daoist will help you divine your fortune and predict good or bad luck for you.\"\n",

      "Chen Ping'an didn't stop his steps but turned his head and waved his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Taoist priest didn't give up and leaned forward, raising his voice, \"Young man, in the past, this humble Daoist would charge ten wen for divination stick readings. But today, I'll make an exception and only charge you three wen! Of course, if you draw a top-quality stick, you may consider adding an extra wen as a symbol of joy. And if it's an extremely auspicious sign, a superlative sign, this humble Daoist will only charge you five wen. How about it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Chen Ping'an's footsteps in the distance clearly paused for a moment. The young Taoist promptly stood up, seizing the opportunity, and said loudly, \"Early in the morning, you're the first customer, so I'll be generous. Sit down and draw a stick. To be honest, this humble Daoist will write some yellow paper talismans for you, which can help pray for blessings for your ancestors, accumulate Yin virtue. With this humble Daoist's ability, I can't promise that it'll make you extremely wealthy, but I can guarantee an extra 1-2 blessings. It's worth a try.\" Chen Ping'an hesitated for a moment, then turned back and sat on the stool in front of the stall.\n",

      "Chen Ping'an hesitated, then suddenly said, \"I won't draw a stick. Can you just write a yellow paper talisman for me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In Chen Ping'an's memory, this wandering young Taoist had already been in the town for at least five to six years. His appearance hadn't changed much, always amiable to everyone. Usually, he helped people by reading faces, divining fortunes, and drawing divination sticks. Occasionally, he even wrote letters. What was interesting was that on the table before him, there was a cylinder that held 108 bamboo divination sticks. Over the years, no one in town had drawn a top-quality stick, nor had anyone ever drawn a bottom-quality stick from the cylinder, as if all 108 sticks were neither bad nor good.\n",

It would be an injustice to call this Taoist priest a complete fraud. The town is not that big, if all he did was deceive and cheat, he would have been driven out long ago. Therefore, this young Taoist must possess some real skills, not just in fortune-telling and divination. Rather, he seems to be especially effective in healing minor ailments. Many people who drank his symbolic water would quickly recover from their illnesses, which was quite miraculous.\n",

      "As for what he wrote, Chen Ping'an had no idea.\n",
